A crushed felt cap sat on his head over a fringe of gray hair that protruded on all sides.

He stood upright on the boulder, the cloak waved behind him with a loud, almost horizontal flutter... The sound swelled, louder, and louder... Then Stomp found himself crouching on the floor, the pebbles pressing painfully through his Thin trousers, and when he straightened up in a daze he saw the old man sitting with his legs dangling on the boulder, humming a tune and holding a long-handled pipe from which thick clouds of smoke rose.`
