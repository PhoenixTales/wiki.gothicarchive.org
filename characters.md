- seems to overlap with unnamed `VLK_50` from another alpha build where `Sira` is missing, who gives speeches to diggers
  - `VLK_50_VlkSpeech`: `Listen to me and you will see better times. If there are no better times the world will stumble and fall, or the stars will come down.`

## The Old Man
- only appears in _Sleeper's Ban_
- protects _Stomp_ from thugs after he was thrown into the _barrier_ in similar way as _Diego_ did in _Gothic I_
- `The voice was deep, rich, and accompanied by a strange growl`
- `A figure crouched directly above him on the boulder in front of which he was huddled. He had no idea how he could have approached so unnoticed`
- `At first glance he looked old, thin, huddled as he sat cross-legged on this stone. He looked around with a gaunt, mischievous face. A crushed felt cap sat on his head over a fringe of gray hair that protruded on all sides. A worn gray cotton shirt swayed around skinny limbs, and a threadbare, frayed cloak arched over his shoulders. Noticeable were the eyes, which appraised the group with a cheerful look. They were yellow! Radiant and accompanied by a happy, serene wink.`
- `bright yellow eyes and a relaxed grin on his lean, weathered face`
- `the old man's cloak began to sway, although he felt no wind (...) the noise rang out: It seemed to come deeply from the earth, the stones under his feet vibrated at its sound. It was a growl, underlaid by hissing noises, deep, booming, and slowly rising. (...) the old man had risen. He stood upright on the boulder, the cloak waved behind him with a loud, almost horizontal flutter... The sound swelled, louder, and louder... Then Stomp found himself crouching on the floor, the pebbles pressing painfully through his Thin trousers, and when he straightened up in a daze he saw the old man sitting with his legs dangling on the boulder, humming a tune and holding a long-handled pipe from which thick clouds of smoke rose.`
- `he turned to the old man "I have to you thank you, I don't know what..." He fell silent because the boulder was empty. Looking around wildly, Stomp searched the beach and saw no sign of the old man anywhere. Only a cloud of the sweet smelling smoke that had emerged from the strange person's pipe still hovered over the stone.`
