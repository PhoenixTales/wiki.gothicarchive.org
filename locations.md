### City of Cresh a Suul
```
A city, or rather a pueblo-like complex, all born from the ice of the mountain, which covered almost the entire flank of this colossus; Hundreds of houses were there, with ledges, stairs, and walkways connecting them. Myriads of graceful turrets and minarets, which, in defiance of all laws of gravity, rose above them in the most impossible nooks and crannies. Everything seemed to be made of green, glittering ice.
```
```
Point at the base of the mountain (...) Stomp took a closer look and saw a free-standing portal there, made up of two irregularly shaped ice columns, behind which a flight of stairs led up into the city and after about forty meters lost itself in the tangle of houses, turrets and stairs. Finally he reached the portal, (...) massive stalagmites of greenish-white shimmering ice, towering a good ten meters high. Beyond it was the wide, gently curved staircase.
