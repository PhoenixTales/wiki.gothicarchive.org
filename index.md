Welcome to the Gothic Archive wiki. 

It is a compilation of knowledge about the universe of cRPG Gothic (2001) by Piranha Bytes coming from:
- pre-release official promotional materials
- unreleased and abandoned ideas, documents and demos made by Piranha Bytes members
- high-level knowledge about the realm and the world present in the final release of the game

### Speculation
Speculation about some apparent inconsistencies is acceptable as long as it is aligned with official material (decision up to moderators) and under the heading "Speculation".

### Other games
We are also open to including information from other Piranha Bytes projects, as long as it expands on ideas that first appeared no later than in the final release of Gothic I, and is under the heading "Other Games".

## About us
We are a [team of a few hardcore Gothic I fans](https://phoenixtales.de/) who did not like the design direction the series took after Gothic I. 

In our fan projects we are trying to extrapolate in the opposite direction. We analyze early and rejected ideas of Piranha Bytes, expand and build around them. 

We need this compilation internally to ensure consensus on what the "pre-alpha-to-final Gothic I" canon entails. We make it public under Creative Commons license to benefit other Gothic nerds and fan projects in the making.
