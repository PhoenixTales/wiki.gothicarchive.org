Welcome to Gothic Archive wiki. 

We document here information about the game universe known from pre-release promotional materials of Gothic I and from the game. We hope to help in development of fan projects that are compatible with this version of the universe.

Speculation about how to interpret some apparent inconsistencies is accepted, as long as it is very closely aligned with official material (decision up to moderators) and under heading "Speculation".

We are also open to including information from other Piranha Bytes projects, and as long as it expands on ideas already existing at release of Gothic I, does not contradict any earlier material (decision up to moderators) and is under heading "Other Gamess".
