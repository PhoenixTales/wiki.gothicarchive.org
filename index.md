Welcome to Gothic Archive wiki. 

It is a compilation of knowledge about the universe of cRPG Gothic (2001) by Piranha Bytes coming from:
- pre-release official promotional materials
- unreleased and abandoned ideas, documents and demos made by Piranha Bytes members
- high level knowledge about the realm and the world present in the final release

### Speculation
Speculation about how to interpret some apparent inconsistencies is accepted, as long as it is very closely aligned with official material (decision up to moderators) and under heading "Speculation".

### Other games
We are also open to including information from other Piranha Bytes projects, and as long as it expands on ideas that first appeared no later than in the final release of _Gothic I_, and is under heading "Other Games".

## About us
We are [team of few hardcore Gothic I fans](https://phoenixtales.de/) who did not like the design direction the series took after Gothic I. 

You can say that we are trying to extrapolate in the opposite direction by analyzing early and rejected ideas of Piranha Bytes, expanding and building around them.

We need this wiki internally to ensure we have a consensus of what our "pre-alpha-to-final Gothic I" canon is. We also believe there may be some more fans who may be interested in reading this compilation.
