Welcome to the [Gothic Archive](https://gothicarchive.org) wiki. 

It is a compilation of knowledge about the universe of cRPG Gothic (2001) by Piranha Bytes. We cover:
- pre-release official promotional materials
- unreleased and abandoned ideas, documents and demos made by Piranha Bytes members
- book [Schl√§fer's Bann](https://media.gothicarchive.org/documents/sleepersban/Schlafers_Bann_Endversion_2020.pdf) by Alexander Wittmann
- cutscenes, dialogues and booklet from the final release

Because the source material is so diverse and comes from various stages of development, major contraditions are present and expected. Making practical use of it requires coming up with some subjective interpretation and corrections. It is not in scope of Gothic Archive, instead we do that at [`docs.phoenixthegame.com`](https://docs.phoenixthegame.com/).

### Speculation
Speculation on how to fix / elaborate on Piranha Bytes' material is not welcome here. Please only quote, summarize or synthesize, and avoid including your original ideas that are not present in the source material. If you create fanfiction very closely based on material here and want to share it, you are welcome to do it [on our Discord server](https://discord.gg/em6gfE52zz) instead.

### Other games
We accept information from other Piranha Bytes projects, but only if it expands on ideas that first appeared during development of Gothic I, and is separated under sub-heading "Other Games".

## About us
We are a [team of a few hardcore Gothic I fans](https://phoenixtales.de/) who did not like the design direction the series took after Gothic I. 

In our fan projects we are trying to extrapolate in the opposite direction. We analyze early and rejected ideas of Piranha Bytes, expand and build around them. We personally met with Mike Hoge who originally created the world and story design, and gathered additional pieces of material from other former Piranha Bytes members.

We need this wiki internally to ensure consensus on what the "pre-alpha-to-final Gothic I" canon possibly entails. We make it public to benefit other Gothic nerds and fan projects in the making.
