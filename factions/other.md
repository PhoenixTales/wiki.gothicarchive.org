## Crusaders
- mentioned in _Phoenix_ Konzept from 11/1997
- possibly some subset of Sect Templars (?)
- there's mention of _Crusade_ (`Kreuzzug`)

## Removed Pre-Alpha Guards
- German: `Der Waechter` / `WCH`
- it is almost removed already in 0.56 alpha (`GIL_WCH = 18; // (gibt es nicht mehr)` - `no longer used`)
- in very early alpha builds was guild separate from both _Mercenaries Of Old Camp_ and _Guards Of New Camp_
- on the guild list, they are between _The Orcs_ and _The Sleeper_, and word `Waechter` is only mentioned elsewhere in context of orcs
- but there's also a file `INF_WCH.BAK` which inside contains code for `Inf_Sld` and `GIL_SLD`, suggesting it could be a renamed version of _Mercenaries Of Old Camp_
- set as owner of moveable world objects of type `TableHeavy` (maybe to attack you if you chop up the table in front of _Big Boss_)
- in 0.56 alpha there are two NPCs with this guild set, who wear clothing of other guilds:
  - _Mastermind_, wears _Guru_ robes
  - _Hawkeye_, wears _Thiefs_ clothes (`thief.asc`)

## Masters
- German: `Die Meister` (`MST`)
- secret secondary guild accepting members of all the camps
- it's much harder to discover and join than the three camps
- known members: Diego, Milten, Lester, Gorn, Lares
- player was supposed to have a chance of discovering and joining it
- `SLD_21_NSCASpeech`: `Just listen people. This is the masters message.` (unclear if he actually means this guild)

## Quentin's Gang
- together with the _Organisation of the New Camp_, also known as the _Rogues_
- according to early version of the story, they used be part of _The Organisation of New Camp_, but were expelled or left
- subgroups:
  - _Robbers_ (German: `Raeuber`)
  - _Blackmailers_ (German: `Erpresser`)
  - _Stooges_ ("illegally" prepare _Sect's Drugs_ in a cave, threatened retreat to _Quentin's Camp_)

## Stomp's Family
- only mentioned in _Sleeper's Ban_
- `respected merchant family`
- `one of the largest trading houses in his hometown, used to living in a large mansion, looked after by servants`
- wife of the family's head died, and he married again
  - he has two sons, one from the first marriage who is his heir, and one from second marriage who is jealous of being the heir
  - `his stepbrother, the man who came into the family through his father's second marriage and envied him from the start the position of heir.`
