title: Shadows Of The Old Camp
---

- secretive spies and assassins working for _Ore Barons_
- their headquarters are in the dungeons of _Old Camp Castle_
- for obvious reasons they are unlikely to wear easily recognizable uniforms and may even pretend to be members of other factions
- in the final release of the game they are no longer spies, assassins nor secretive, and instead are more like simply a lower rank of the _Old Camp Guard_ and consistently wear red armors
- _The Invisible Man_ is their leader (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
- 15 people: the leader, 4 Assassins, 8 Spies, messenger and recruiter

### Assassins
- German: `Meuchler`
- also called `Scorpions`, the stings of the baron (_Sleeper's Ban_)
- `capable Shadows for routine work` (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
- 4 of them live in _Old Camp_

### The Spies
- German: `Spione` and `Spitzel`
- they work undercover and pretend to be normal members of all the camps, including _Old Camp_
- 4 of them live in _Old Camp_, 1 in _New Camp_, 1 in _Free Camp_ and 1 in _Sect Camp_ (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
