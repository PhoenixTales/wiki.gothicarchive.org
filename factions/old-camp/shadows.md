title: Shadows Of The Old Camp
---

- secretive spies and assassins working for _Ore Barons_
- their headquarters are in the dungeons of _Old Camp Castle_
- for obvious reasons they are unlikely to wear easily recognizable uniforms and may even pretend to be members of other factions
- in the final release of the game they are no longer spies, assassins nor secretive, and instead are more like simply a lower rank of the _Old Camp Guard_ and consistently wear red armors
- _The Invisible Man_ is their leader (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
- 15 people: the leader, 4 Assassins, 8 Spies, messenger and recruiter
