- in original English translation of the alpha builds called `soldiers`
  - `Nobody'll ever get away with killing a soldier of the ore-barons`
- `the group that puts the Barons' ideas into practice.`
- supposed to protect the _Diggers_
  - `You've knocked down a Digger. That wasn't clever. The Ore-Barons pay us for protecting them, so don't do that shit again`
- they don't trust people who can speak with Orcs, this is the reason why they did not hire _Sira_ as one of them
