title: The Mercenaries Of Old Camp
---

- in final released version of Gothic I known as `The Guards Of Old Camp`
- in German version of `Sleeper's Ban` known as `Söldnergilde` and in alpha builds as `Die Söldner` (`SLD`)
- in original English translation of the alpha builds called `soldiers`
  - `Nobody'll ever get away with killing a soldier of the ore-barons`
- `the group that puts the Barons' ideas into practice.`
- supposed to protect the _Diggers_
  - `You've knocked down a Digger. That wasn't clever. The Ore-Barons pay us for protecting them, so don't do that shit again`
- they don't trust people who can speak with Orcs, this is the reason why they did not hire _Sira_ as one of them
  - source: comment in 0.56 alpha script `_Autoren/Vahdat/Npc_Sira.BAK`
- 32 people: _The Captain_, _Arena Master_, _The One-Eyed_, _The Lieutenant_, _Gladiators_, _Gate Guards_, _Castle Guards_, _The Grinder_
- 3 of the _Mercenaries_ specialize in arena fighters and use title `Gladiators` (German: `Gladiatoren`) (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
- `Hierarchy has a strict military feel, discipline is enforced through brute force` (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
- `Despite strong denials, the Mercenaries differ little in their structure from the Orcs!` (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
- `Since the rebellion, Gomez' guards have been walking about in the jail warders' armours` (`SIT_1_OC_RYAN_FEARFOX` / 0.94 alpha)

## The Captain Of Mercenaries
- German: `Söldnerhauptmann`

## Gortak
- _Old Camp_ member burned alive by angry _Fire Mage_ mentioned in alpha 0.94
- `Before he could reach the river, he got burned. Shinig like a human torch, that poor boy. And he was screaming like a piglet getting slaughtered. Well, never annoy a mage.`
- probably a _Mercenary Of Old Camp_, since _diggers_ have no access to the mages
