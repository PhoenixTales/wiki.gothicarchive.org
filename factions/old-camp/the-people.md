title: The People Of Old Camp
---

- German: `Das Volk` (`VLK`)
- `Not an actual guild, rather a collection of all NPCs in the Old Camp that don't belong to any "proper" guild` (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
- around 50 people: includes _Beggars_, _Dayworkers_, _Crooks_, _Traders_, _Thugs_, _Burnouts_, _Tinkerers_
- in original English translation of the early alpha translated in one place as `normal people`
  - `NOV_130_FriendDefeatedByVlk`: `You lost a fight with the normal people.`
- early in the development they were merged with _Slave Diggers_ (`GIL_VLK = 5; // Volk/Buddler`)
- named alpha members: `Crumb`, `Dumb`, `Numb`, `Sira`, `Nimblefinger`
  - `Nimblefinger` is officially a _Slave Digger_, but actually earns by trading stolen goods
  - `Crumb`, `Dumb` and `Numb` spend their time listening to preaching of `Quicktongue`
