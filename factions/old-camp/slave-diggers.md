title: Slave Diggers
---

- miners of the _Old Camp_
- they are forced to work in their mine and can only keep a fraction of what they dig, as opposed to members of _Miner's Association_ of _Free Camp_
- disdainfully called `work horses` or `working animals` by other _Old Camp_ members
  - `KDF_40_FoeKilledDigger`: `Hey, nobody gets away with killing our working animals`
  - `OU_NPCS_DEMO3_SLD_GRIMFACE_225`: `Trying to outright talk us into giving up our workhorses` (German: `Versucht doch glatt uns unsere Arbeitstiere abzuschwatzen`)
- early in the development they were merged with _The People Of Old Camp_ (`GIL_VLK = 5; // Volk/Buddler`)

- `very muscular`
- `Possession: LOTS of Ore - Manages the wealth of the mining community`
- `would now be a Mercenary, but they didn't take him when they found out that he spoke orcish`
  - _Mercenary_ refers here to _Old Camp Mercenaries_ (`SLD`)
- the _Shadows_ are tried to recruit him, but `so far he has only accepted smaller orders` from them
- `Behaves like a group leader. Represents his mining community. Protects team when they are threatened by Shadows or Mercenaries. Speaks out when arguments arise between the Diggers.`
- seems to overlap with unnamed `VLK_50` from another alpha build where `Sira` is missing, who gives speeches to diggers
