title: Slave Diggers
---

- miners of the _Old Camp_
- they are forced to work in their mine and can only keep a fraction of what they dig, as opposed to members of _Miner's Association_ of _Free Camp_
- disdainfully called `work horses` or `working animals` by other _Old Camp_ members
  - `KDF_40_FoeKilledDigger`: `Hey, nobody gets away with killing our working animals`
  - `OU_NPCS_DEMO3_SLD_GRIMFACE_225`: `Trying to outright talk us into giving up our workhorses` (German: `Versucht doch glatt uns unsere Arbeitstiere abzuschwatzen`)
