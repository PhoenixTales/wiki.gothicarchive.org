- German: `Der Schurferbund` (`SFB`)
- also known as scrapers (German: `Schuerfer`) or prospectors
- led by The _Mine Inspector_, and his right hand _The Sniffer_
- they are working in their mine voluntarily and keep most of what they dig, as opposed to _Slave Diggers_ of _Old Camp_
- in the final game release, translated as `scrapers` (`NAME_Schuerfer = "Scraper"`)
- work at _Free Mine_ and live at _Free Camp_
- `A whole pack of unruly miners has settled in the Free Camp.`
- allied with the _New Camp_
- pay _Guards Of New Camp_ for protection from _Mercenaries Of Old Camp_
  - `The miners from the Free Camp need our protection and we need their ore.` (`Inf_Grd_FL`)
- they conduct their own trade with the outside world separately from _Old Camp_
  - they use the same _Exchange Place_ as _Old Camp Mercenaries_, who are aggressive about this
  - `Escorting the hunters' association to the trading center is usually associated with trouble. Those damned mercenaries` (`Inf_Tpl_HP`)
