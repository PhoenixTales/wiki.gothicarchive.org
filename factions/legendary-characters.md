## Ancient General
- called `General`, `powerful warlord` and `Paladin` in different documents
- `Dead Paladin in ancient temple behind door, sieged by undeads -> has weapon against Sleeper with him` (from early alpha docs)
- `general who wielded URIZIEL in the battle against the Orc` (G1-final / DIA_KDF_404_Xardas.d)
- `the Orcs took it from a powerful warlord`

## The Old Man
- only appears in _Sleeper's Ban_
- almost for sure the human form of the _Shugul Sath_, an ancient supernatural being
- protects _Stomp_ from thugs after he was thrown into the _barrier_ in similar way as _Diego_ did in _Gothic I_
- `The voice was deep, rich, and accompanied by a strange growl`
- `A figure crouched directly above him on the boulder in front of which he was huddled. He had no idea how he could have approached so unnoticed`
- `At first glance he looked old, thin, huddled as he sat cross-legged on this stone. He looked around with a gaunt, mischievous face. A crushed felt cap sat on his head over a fringe of gray hair that protruded on all sides. A worn gray cotton shirt swayed around skinny limbs, and a threadbare, frayed cloak arched over his shoulders. Noticeable were the eyes, which appraised the group with a cheerful look. They were yellow! Radiant and accompanied by a happy, serene wink.`
- `bright yellow eyes and a relaxed grin on his lean, weathered face`
- `the old man's cloak began to sway, although he felt no wind (...) the noise rang out: It seemed to come deeply from the earth, the stones under his feet vibrated at its sound. It was a growl, underlaid by hissing noises, deep, booming, and slowly rising. (...) the old man had risen. He stood upright on the boulder, the cloak waved behind him with a loud, almost horizontal flutter... The sound swelled, louder, and louder... Then Stomp found himself crouching on the floor, the pebbles pressing painfully through his Thin trousers, and when he straightened up in a daze he saw the old man sitting with his legs dangling on the boulder, humming a tune and holding a long-handled pipe from which thick clouds of smoke rose.`
- `he turned to the old man "I have to you thank you, I don't know what..." He fell silent because the boulder was empty. Looking around wildly, Stomp searched the beach and saw no sign of the old man anywhere. Only a cloud of the sweet smelling smoke that had emerged from the strange person's pipe still hovered over the stone.`

## Rhobar I
- ancestor of Rhobar I
- according to Gothic I handbook father of _Rhobar II_, according to Mike Hoge there were kings in between

### Other games
- Gothic 3 `Book Of Rhobar` says: `The barbarians lived in Nordmar. And Rhobar was one of them. (...) And Innos said to Rhobar: Descend from the mountains, and defeat my enemies. And Rhobar waged war against the orcs. And the wrath of Innos descended upon them. And Rhobar was victorious. Once his enemies were defeated, Innos said to him: This is where you shall establish your kingdom. And Rhobar did as he was bidden.`
