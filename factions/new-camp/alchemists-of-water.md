title: Alchemists Of Water
---

- in early design docs referred to as `Healing Mages` (German: `Heilmagier`)
- in the final game release known as `Water Mages`
  - also mentioned as `Circle Of Water`, already in alpha
- in poor relationship with _Alchemists Of Fire_ under the barrier
  - `KDF_40_FriendKilledMage`: `we don't like the circle of water`
  - `we don't like` doesn't mean hostility; the guild attitudes between them are neutral (`guilds.d`/`GIL_ATTITUDES`, `Orpheus Guilds V1`)
- 6 of them accidentally imprisoned in Khorinis Mine Valley
  - `have been rambling for years that they want to carry out an escape plan` (_Sleeper's Ban_)
  - `they brew their potions with the ore and spoil it so that it can no longer be used; and this brew has so far not harmed the barrier`  (_Sleeper's Ban_)
- dominate the _New Camp_, _Lee_ is jealous about that (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)

## The Three Healers Of Water Mages
- all are mentioned in design doc `NPCs per Guild`, have no names nor significant differences
- German: `der Geneser`, `der Heiler`, `der Wunddoktor`
- 1: `alchemist, powerful healer; teacher & mission giver`, `recruits the player character`, `a little too good-natured`
- 2: `routine healing worker`, `harsh like an overworked, annoyed ward doctor in the hospital`
- 3: `visits other camps to earn ore nuggets`

## Saturas, Master Of Water
- German: `Meister des Wassers`
- leader of _Alchemists Of Water_ (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
- disciple of the _Demon Summoner_ (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
- `Supreme Healing Mage; only reviver close to the people` (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
- `somewhat bossy/arrogant` (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
