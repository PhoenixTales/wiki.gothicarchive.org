title: Guardians Of New Camp
---

## The Armorer
- German: `der Waffenmeister`
- `teacher of the Guardians` (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)

## Cord
- former member of _Royal Army_ / `king's staff` and old friend of _Lee_
- `I've been with Lee since I got here. We already knew each other outside. I heard the story of why he ended up here back then. I was part of the king's staff. I heard them talking about getting Lee out of the way. Lee had no chance. I wanted to speak up in his defense, but it was of no use. When the traitors found out that I wanted to speak for Lee, they framed me for a minor offense. A little later they took me to the cliff too.` (`Sit_1_NC_Cord_TrainFighters` / alpha 0.94)

## The Diplomat Of The Guardians
- German: `der Diplomat`
- pretends to be a member of _Guardians Of New Camp_, in reality a _Spy_ of _Shadows Of The Old Camp_
- `very charismatic, respected Guardian`(design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
- `maintains contact with other guilds; is traveling as an agent for the Guardians` (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
- `in reality, a double agent for the Ore Barons` (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)

## Gorn
- `muscular giant`
- `Where I come from, opponents are invited for a feast before they are killed...`
  - he is dark-skinned, and from _Sleeper's Ban_ we know about a dark skinned tribe which does just that
  - plot twist is that after being killed, these enemies participate in the feast in role of the meal
- member of both _Guardians Of The New Camp_ and _The Masters_

## Lee, The Lord Protector
- initially he was serving as a royal bodyguard
  - source: alpha docs and `Sit_1_NC_Lee_Dam` from alpha 0.94
- ex-general, `war hero`
- also called `Duke` in design doc `Story 3.3 draft`
- convicted for lifetime of forced labor for murder of the `king's wife`
  - he insists that he's innocent, and that he was framed by conspiring nobles
  - according to earlier version of his story, his arest was related to some piece of correspondence written by another nobleman, again without him actually committing any crime
- referred to as `The Lord` or `The Lord Protector` (German: `der Lord-Protektor`) (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
  - this may suggest that as a _Royal General_ he used to be a member of _Myrtanian Nobility_
- leader of _Guardians Of New Camp_
- `jealous of the dominance of the Healing Mages` (design doc `NPCs per Guild`)
- old friend of _Cord_ from the times when they both served the king before getting falsely convinced

> I was one of the best generals of this country.
> I've spent my whole life fighting for my country.
> But the nobles didn't like me, because the King listened to my advice. 
> And they knew I posed a threat to their dirty business.
> They used the King's wife to get me. I was blamed for her pointless murder.

> I served at the king's court as leader of the king's bodyguard... for many years.
> One stormy night the guards at the gate reported a mounted messenger sent by the Count of Meidheim.
> I led the messenger into the throne room and handed him over to the hall guards present.
> As I crossed the courtyard just a few moments later, I found a scroll, laying unsealed in the mud of the stable.
> I bent down and took a look at it. It was a message from the Count of Meidheim to the king.
> I was horrified. Not only the Count's head would be at stake due to the content!
> When I still held the message in my hand, mouth open and disbelieving, I heard the messenger's calls.
> 'Guards! Seize him!'
> My guards approached hesitantly. I followed them and they led me to the king.
> I was accused of treason and brought here, behind the barrier. So they thought they had silenced me.
> Only my years of loyalty to the king saved my life, but I had to give up my freedom for his intrigue.
