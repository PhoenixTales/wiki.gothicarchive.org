## Darkvision
- German: `Dunkelsicht`
- seeing in the dark
- Some monsters that mage can transform into have darkvision

## Hide in Shadows
- characters / creatures with this ability are barely visible when standing in semi-darkness
- probably are not focusable by the player?
- are not detectable by AI that depend on seeing (some monsters can however detect others based on smell and hearing)
