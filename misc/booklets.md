Many years ago, in a distant land, people lived in a kingdom they called Myrtana. It was a thriving kingdom, the granaries were full year after year, and the mines yielded good copper, bronze, and ore so that no one had to suffer. Above all stood the priests of the gods, whose power and influence were great. The gods were well-disposed towards the people, at the top stood Innos, the god of the sun and of the law, who was worshiped as the first and highest god and whose priests were the magicians of fire. The priests of the god Adanos, who forms the balance between good and evil, were the magicians of the water circle, only the god of darkness and death, Beliar, were not ordained priests, for his powers were of a dark nature.
Prosperity reigned in the cities, and scholars and magicians knew how to explain the world, the stars, and magic to one another.
But where there is contentment and security, envy and distrust soon grow. Wicked men enrich themselves with the fruits of their labor, and spread suspicion and fear among the weak.
So it came about that soon the neighboring realms wanted to claim Myrtana's treasures for themselves. Above all, the realm of Varant.
Armies of horsemen came over the hills of the kingdom, ships of dark wood drew up on the horizon and hoisted the flags of battle. The armies of Myrtana went out to defend what was their homeland.
It was war.
The King's Armada sank ship after ship, but suffered great losses themselves in the process. The battles on land were fought swiftly and with great ferocity from the start, for both sides demanded victory. But no matter how many battles Myrtana's men won, the news reached them immediately that the Varanten cavalry armies were invading the country again elsewhere. The war, whose end was soon longed for, dragged on from skirmish to battle and lasted many moons. And many a man who set out to make a name for himself, to earn his living, or simply to defend his homeland soon found himself with his face in the grass. They came in thousands and fell in thousands. But King Rhotbar was not satisfied with protecting the country's borders. In order to defeat the enemy once and for all, he and his men advanced deep into the country and conquered counties, villages and cities. And whatever his troops could not hold was razed to the ground. This war lasted more than four solstices. His strategic prowess and that of a general, the interplay of army and magic, helped him to stand at the gates of the capital of Varant on an autumn day. As if awakened from a dream, the Varanten saw the army camp in front of their city and surrendered.
The gates were opened, arms drawn down, and at the head of his men King Rhotbar rode battle-scarred into the city with the dignity of a true ruler. The city was not plundered, the men and women not taken into captivity. King Rhotbar had the ruler of Varant hanged, appointed a governor and a council to rule the kingdom from now on, and returned to Myrtana. He had earned recognition for his greatness, but the price he paid was high. Many men, sons, fathers and brothers had given their lives for the kingdom. In addition, supplies were running low and winter was just around the corner. There was hunger and despair in many places. That winter King Rhotbar died, weakened and consumed by the wounds of war.
His son, Rhotbar the Second, took the scepter in silence, without ceremony or celebration, and summoned his priests, his advisers, and the scholars. Together they developed plans to bring the empire back to the level of prosperity that his father had brought the empire to.
But when the winter was over, the next danger threatened the kingdom. Orc hordes from the northlands swept across the borders and plundered hamlets and estates. Again the king sent out his armies, had borders fortified and sent protective troops into the contested areas. Numerous battles again claimed many lives. They were small, brief skirmishes with no victors, but King Rhotbar knew the orcs were strong enough to wage war against Myrtana. But his army had grown small and few weapons were left at his disposal. He needed ore to make new weapons. The situation was bad all over the country, especially in the mining towns. Thieves and deserters were up to mischief and many prisoners escaped from the mines. Above all, the city of Khorinis, one of the main ore suppliers, was too important for the king not to have to intervene. Because in the mines of Khorinis the prisoners dug a special, rare ore.
Magical Ore. This ore, when melted properly, makes any blade indestructible and gives it a sharpness and hardness which no armor can withstand.
The king summoned the twelve most powerful magicians in the realm, six from the circle of water and six from the circle of fire. He ordered them to erect a magical barrier around the Khorinis mining colony to stop the numerous escape attempts by the workers. A barrier that let all life in but not out. Together, the Twelve Magicians developed a magic formula to do this.
When the formula was ready, the Twelve Magicians set out to build the barrier. With the help of five magical foci, which they set up according to a ritual pattern, they concentrated their power and spoke the words of the spell.
Lightning flashed in the sky and dark clouds gathered, like a hurricane the streams of magic united. The sky turned black and a rising rumble suddenly erupted in exploding thunder.
And then she was there.
Over a vast area, much larger than previously calculated, the barrier stretched across the land like a gigantic dome.
The mages were dismayed to find themselves trapped within the barrier. The prisoners took advantage of the opportunity and killed the guards trapped with them in the barrier. The magicians didn't touch them, on the one hand for fear of their powers, on the other hand because they quickly realized that without the help of the magicians they would never be able to leave the barrier again. Into the guardhouses moved the prisoners, led by Gomez, the one who had led the uprising, who first rebelled against the guards. But the joy of victory soon gave way to concerns about food and survival. The prisoners knew that they depended on the goods and goods of the empire. Just like the king needed the magical ore.
So they quickly came up with a plan that initially satisfied both sides. For deliveries of ore, the king paid with goods so that the captives could survive. But not all prisoners wanted to continue working for the king. One of them said it out loud and left the camp. His name was Lee. Some men followed him. They founded their own camp near another mine, which from then on was simply called the New Camp. At his side stood the Mages of Water, who continued to seek a plan to destroy the barrier. For this they collected the ore from their mine, which the magicians needed for their research. Their goal was to find a way out.
The Mages of Fire stay with Gomez in the Old Camp. Thus the magicians were represented in both camps and also kept the prisoners from killing each other. With the goods from the kingdom, the survival of the prisoners was secured and Gomez appointed the strongest prisoners to his guard and soon he was ruling his own kingdom, in which all were prisoners, but while some were toiling in the mine, Gomez let the kingdom pay him better and better and very soon wine, good food and books for the magicians were on the list of trade goods.
Many moons had passed when a man in the prison colony began to proclaim his visions of freedom. He called himself Y'Berion, the enlightened one, and his words were of deep faith and power, and presently he withdrew to the swamp with a band of followers back where they set up their own camp. Strange powers were soon reported, of sorcery and incantations unknown even to the magicians. And this camp also grew.
They lived from the cultivation of swampweed, the smoke of which was coveted because it gave people pleasant dreams. They traded this herb with the Old Camp and otherwise lived rather sparsely but contentedly.
The kingdom, meanwhile, was gradually recovering from the wounds of the past. Wheat thrived in the fields and new trade treaties were made.
Only the barrier gave notice of the failure of all attempts to destroy it.
And then the orcs came.
Like a storm swept over the land, the king's armies cut down and killed every human being that fell into their hands. So King Rhotbar II prepared for war again, and every man was sent to the frontiers.
In those days anyone guilty of a crime, no matter how small, was taken to the Khorinis mining colony. The fire burned day and night in the smelters and the hammering of the smiths could be heard constantly.
Today another convict is brought into the mine.
This condemned person is you. Just another prisoner who will be trapped in the barrier for the rest of his life. At least they think so....
What nobody sees, nobody can judge.
