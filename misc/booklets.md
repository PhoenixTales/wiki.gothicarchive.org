```
Many years ago, in a distant land, people lived in a kingdom of Myrtana.
It was a thriving kingdom, the granaries were full year after year, and the mines yielded good copper, bronze, and ore so that no one had to suffer poverty.
Priests of the gods stood above everyone, and their power and influence were great. The gods were good towards the people.
At the top stood Innos, the god of the Sun and the law, who was worshiped as the first and highest god and whose priests were Mages Of Fire.
The Mages Of The Circle Of Water were priests of the god Adanos, who ensures the balance between good and evil.
Only the god of darkness and death, Beliar, had no priests ordained, as his powers were of a dark nature.

The cities prospered, scholars and magicians shared their knowledge of the world, the stars, and magic.
But where there is contentment and security, envy and distrust soon grow. Wicked men enrich themselves with the fruits of labor of the weak, and spread suspicion and fear among them.

Soon the neighboring realms wanted to claim Myrtana's treasures for themselves. Above all, the realm of Varant.
Armies of horsemen came over the hills of the kingdom, ships of dark wood drew up on the horizon and hoisted the flags of battle.
The armies of Myrtana went out to defend their homeland.

It was war.

The King's Armada sank ship after ship, but suffered great losses themselves in the process.
The battles on land were fought swiftly and with great ferocity from the start, as the both sides demanded victory.
But no matter how many battles Myrtana's men won, the news reached them immediately that the Varantian cavalry was invading the country again elsewhere.
The war, whose end was soon longed for, dragged on from skirmish to battle and lasted many moons.
Many men who set out to make a name for themselves, to earn their living, or simply to defend their homeland soon found themselves with their faces in the dirt.
They came in thousands and fell in thousands.
King Rhotbar was not satisfied just with protecting the country's borders.
In order to defeat the enemy once and for all, he and his men advanced deep into the lands of Varant, conquered counties, villages and cities.
And whatever his troops could not hold, they burned to the ground.
The war lasted more than four solstices.
Rhotbar's great strategy, and that of his general, the interplay of army and magic, helped him to stand at the gates of the capital of Varant on an autumn day.
As if suddely awakened and seeing the enemy army camping in front of their city, Varantians surrendered.

The gates were opened, weapons surrendered, and King Rhotbar rode battle-scarred into the city with the dignity of a true ruler, with his army following.
The city was not plundered, the men and women not taken into captivity.
King Rhotbar had the ruler of Varant hanged, appointed a new governor and council, and returned to Myrtana.
He had earned recognition for his greatness, but the price he paid was high.
Many men, sons, fathers and brothers had sacrificed their lives for this victory.
In addition, supplies were running low and winter was just around the corner.
There was hunger and despair in many places.
That winter King Rhotbar died, weakened and consumed by the battle wounds.

His son, Rhotbar II, took the scepter in silence, without ceremony or celebration, and summoned his priests, advisers, and the scholars.
Together they developed plans to bring the empire back to the level of prosperity of the great days of his father.

But when the winter was over, the next danger threatened the kingdom.
Orc hordes from the North swept across the borders, plundered villages and estates.
King dispatched the army again, had borders fortified and sent defensive troops into the contested lands.
Numerous battles again claimed many lives.
They were small, brief skirmishes with no victors, but King Rhotbar knew that the orcs were strong enough to wage a long war against Myrtana.
He had fewer and fewer soldiers left, and few weapons left at their disposal. He needed ore to make a new arsenal.
The situation was bad all over the country, and especially in the mining towns.
Thieves and deserters were a menace and many prisoners escaped from the mines.
Above all, the city of Khorinis, one of the main suppliers of the ore, was too important for the king to not intervene.
Because in the mines of Khorinis the prisoners dug a special, rare ore.

Magic Ore. This ore, when melted properly, makes any blade indestructible and gives it a sharpness and hardness which no armor can withstand.

The king summoned the twelve most powerful mages of the realm, six from the Circle Of Water and six from the Circle Of Fire.
He ordered them to erect a Magic Barrier around the Khorinis Mining Colony to stop the numerous escape attempts by the convicts.
A barrier that would let all life in but not out.
Together, the Twelve Mages developed a magic formula for it.

When the formula was ready, the Twelve Mages set out to create the Barrier.
With the help of five magic Focus Stones, which they set up according to a ritual pattern, they focused their power and uttered the incantation.

Lightning flashed in the sky and dark clouds gathered, as the streams of magic merged like in a hurricane.
The sky turned black and a rising rumble suddenly erupted in exploding thunder.

And then it was there.

Over a vast area, much larger than previously planned, the Barrier stretched across the land like a gigantic dome.
The mages were dismayed to find themselves trapped within it.
The prisoners took advantage of the opportunity and killed the guards trapped with them.
They left the mages unscathed, on the one hand for fear of their powers, on the other hand because they quickly realized that without their help they would never be able to escape.
Gomez, the leader of the uprising who first attacked the guards, now led the prisoners moving from cells into the guard houses.
But their joy of victory soon gave way to concerns about food and survival.
The prisoners knew that they depended on the supplies and goods from the Empire. Just like the king needed their Magic Ore.

So they quickly came up with a plan that initially satisfied both sides.
In return for deliveries of The Ore, king kept providing the supplies so that the convicts could survive.
But not all the prisoners wanted to continue working for the king.
One of them said it out loud and left the camp. His name was Lee. Some men followed him.
They established their own camp near another mine, which they simply called the "New Camp".
At Lee's side stood the Mages of Water, who searched for a way to destroy the barrier.
Together New Camp members stockpiled the ore from their mine, which the mages used for research on finding the way out.

The Mages of Fire stayed with Gomez in the Old Camp.
Thus the mages were represented in both camps and also kept the prisoners from killing each other.
With the supplies from the king, the survival of the convicts was secured and Gomez appointed the strongest inmates as his guard and soon he ruled his own empire.
All his subjects were prisoners, and while many were toiling in the mines, Gomez collected more and more goods from the king. Very soon wine, good food and books of magic joined the list of traded goods.

Many moons had passed when a man in the prison colony began to proclaim his new visions of freedom.
He called himself Y'Berion, the Enlightened One, and his words were of deep faith and power.
With a band of followers they left to the swamps, where they set up their own camp.
Their strange powers were soon reported, of magic and incantations unknown even to the mages.
And this camp also kept growing.
They lived from the cultivation of Swamp Weed, the smoke of which was desired because it gave people pleasant dreams.
They traded this herb with the Old Camp and lived modest but content lives.

The kingdom, meanwhile, was gradually recovering from the wounds of the past.
Wheat thrived in the fields and new trade treaties were made.
Only the Barrier was reminder of the failure of all attempts to destroy it.

And then the orcs came again.

Like a storm, they swept across the land, crushing the king's armies and killing everyone who fell into their hands.
So King Rhotbar II prepared for the war again and every man was sent to the frontier.

In those days, anyone found guilty of any crime, no matter how small, was taken to the mining colony of Khorinis.
The fire burned day and night in the smelters and the hammering in the forges could be heard constantly.

Today, another convict is being brought to the mine.
This convict is you.
Just another prisoner who will be confined within the barrier for the rest of their life.
At least that's what they think...

### Story introduction
```
War sweeps throughout the kingdom. Hoards of ores invading the land from the North. In order to keep the royal army going the blacksmiths of the land strive constantly over their hot coals replenishing weapons and forging new ammunition. Those who break the law in these days are pu-nished hard; they are sent in to slavery in the mines, to delve deep into the earth and dig out ORE for weapons.

There are no guards here, them is no need: The entire mining area is sur-rounded by a magical barrier, this dome is a thousand metres in diameter and stretches over the prison reaching through the underground and meeting to a perfect sphere in the depths of the mines. The barrier can be passed from the outside with no effect whatsoever. No living being can pass through from the inside however, only lifeless ob-jects. In this way the prisoners have the monthly opportunity to exchange the are for food, medicine, even drugs and small luxuries, with the world outside.

Within the prison there is a callous hierarchy, only the moat powerful of prisoners are allowed to receive goods from the outside world and only they have the right to share it among the others. The strong take a huge amount for themselves and live in luxury, the others are made to grind in the mines day after day for their miserable share.

The penal colony has two rival groups. On one side: The old encamp-ment, under the authority of the ore barons who control most of the ex-change between the prison and the outside world, on the other; the smal-ler, new encampment, where the inhabitants are runaways from the other side who have opened their own mine and work desperately on a break-out plan.

Other than that, there is a somewhat remote temple, whose leaders rant and rave their prophecies of the end of the world. Together with the younger members, they constantly celebrate the few days they think they have left. The temple and the new camp have joined together against the old camp and the power of each is more or less equal.

Every now and then there are some attacks and small hold ups between the two sides, for more extensive assaults neither of the two are powerful enough. Both sides however, keep constant watch over the other in case of some otherwise unknown weak point that would aid them in their fight against each other.

This twisted predicament is not your problem, it is just one of them. 

With a surge of desperation and your last ounce of strength you endea-vour to break free from the mean grip of the guards at your sides, con-stantly trying to haul you forwards. Just a few more steps from the edge. You dig your feet into the dirt, to stop these brutes bringing you any clo-ser.The guard to your left, his long, black hair, wet with sweat, clinging to your face, wheezes into your ear "It's time to meet the other side". With mighty hands he grabs your arm and your shoulder, kicking at the backs of your knees with his heavy boots, lessening your defence. The rogue to your right starts to tear at your arm with malicious laughter.You look up. On the other side of the cliff you see the enormous shimmering dome, that you saw from afar, now towering above you. Stunned, you stand gaping at the vastness of the barrier, frozen in a moment of horror. Long enough for the guards to cut through your defence completely.The black-haired brute to your left fumes your legs from underneath you and they drag you to the edge of the cliff on your knees.The dark humming hardly noticeable before, is now clearer and louder. At the centre of the dame you see something similar to a village. Smoke rises from the small huts dotted around the land. Them, beside the rocks is something that looks like the entrance to a mine.

"Stand him up" booms a voice behind you, the "Royal Judge". The two guards quickly drag you up. Stretching your neck to see behind you, you can only catch a glimpse of the tall man. 'Prisoner! For your misdeeds our king to slave-work in the iron-ore mines sentences you. Hem you will stay till the end of your miserable days! Guards " From the corner of your eye you see the tall figure raise his hand. Wriggling wild and furious you strive to escape the strong hold of the two guards, finding of a sudden new strength in the will to live. A powerful kick to your back and you're free from the guards hold and falling over the edge plunging down to-ward the barrier, you fling your arms up to soften the impact but there was none, just a strange sensation as you pass through the hazy green light You fall further and further getting closer and closer to the gmund.NolThere's water, underneath you... Your screams are silenced as you hit the surface of cool water. Lack of strength leaves you no other option but to let yourself float to the surface... AIR!

You see the blurred outlines of the shore. Slowly, with little strength left, you swim towards land and drag yourself gasping onto the muddy sand. You see through half closed eyes, a heavy foot in the mud in front of your face, you look up... mom than one! Prisoners in ragged cloth and rotted pieces of armour unmoving, glaring, with folded arms, one hefty ruffian bends down to you, pulls up your head by your hair and spits at you with rotten breath: "Welcome to jail !"

Myrtana...

In these times the Gods looked upon Myrtana with a kind heart and blessed all the land with peace, lavish crops and an abundance of Copper, bronze and Ore. Myrtana thrived in this blissful age until others received word of their fortune...

The Orks made war upon the land of Myrtana.

Endless raids and battles devastated the land throughout the next years and as Myrtana's armies grew smaller and weaker, the Orks moved on, in greedy destruction. Eventually no longer able to watch the mindless losses to his people, King Rhotbar chose to take desperate measures...

THE BARRIER...

In order to save his most precious mine in Khorinis, where his people gathered magical Ore and forged them into the strongest weapons in the land, King Rhotbar called together 12 of the most talented Mages of Myrtana...

The bright winter sky grew gray and dark as thick black clouds obscured the sun. Lightning flashed across the sky darting through a whirlwind of energy as the mages cast the spell using the foci.A blue-hazed sheet drove across the mine, passing the boundaries of will enclosing even the Mages within its walls.

And so it came to pass that fleeing from greed itself brought greed and thus tribulations upon King Rhotbar. And he was forced to make deals with the prisoners to get at his Ore. Throwing letters through the Barrier was the only way the outside world was able to contact people within the colony.

Those prisoners who had always been the toughest among the miners, saw their chance and agreed to send all the ore they could to the King in exchange for goods from the outside world. Their leader was Gomez. They took over the old castle, killed the guards there and so they created the old camp.

The other prisoners, rebelled against doing anything for the King or Gomez and traveled to another mine area: the free mine, and built there, their own camp: the new camp. Their leader was Lares and they lived from hunting, stealing and farming rice.

Among the prisoners in the old camp were some who talked of visions and strange dreams. They felt themselves misunderstood and different from the rest of the camp. So their leader Y'Berion took them on a journey to find a place where they could dwell amongst themselves. Without explanation he chose a swamp area and so created there a sect named the Brotherhood. The sect members also found that the strange plants that grew there in abundance increased their visions and that some had access to magical powers. They were able to sell these plants and magical scrolls to the rest of the colony and so traded to make a living.

Of the 12 Mages in the colony there were 6 of the circle of fire, and 6 of the circle of water. The fire mages thought it important that theKing should win the war. And so took it upon themselves to control the situation in the old camp. The water mages thought it more important to find out what went wrong with the barrier and to find a way to breech the magical walls surrounding them. They decided to go to the new camp to control the ore from the free mine and were certain it would lead them to freedom. And just another convict is thrown into the Barrier...
