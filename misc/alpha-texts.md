```
The kingdom of Myrtana is at war with the Northern Hordes.
In these times, convicted men are thrown into the prison mine colony
of Khorinis to provide the royal army with its most urgent need:
The magic ore from the mines.

The king's master mages have surrounded the whole area
with a magic barrier, a giant dome which prevents all convicts from escape.

Ten years ago all royal guards were killed during a great revolt.

The convicts now run the mines on their own.

Royal guard: They've brought a prisoner to the cliff.
Judge: Good. Now exchange the goods for the ore.
Camp guard: Look at this! Loads of tasty wine!
Ore baron: Keep your hands off. It's for the ore barons.
