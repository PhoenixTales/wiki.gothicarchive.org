- `Bad luck, 'Blade Fodder' unfortunately lost`

## Holy Water
- `Hey, I have a mission for you! I urgently need a PSI vial.`
- player needs to bring him item `PSI_POTION`, corresponding to _Sruup_

## Devil Mushroom
- `Listen, you're going to do me a favor! I sent my apprentice to Troll Canyon. It's beyond the bridge by the crippled tree. Look for him there and if he's dead, at least bring me the Devil Mushroom. Once you've done that, report to me at the chapel.`
