Then he felt a touch.
It was like something caressed his feet.

It was dominated by greenish shining eyes and a wide, wide mouth with several rows of pointed teeth.
Around were dozens of arm-thick, green-scaled tentacles diving in his direction, making the water splash against the edge of the cliff.
