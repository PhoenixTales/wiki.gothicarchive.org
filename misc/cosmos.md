# The Cosmos

- `In the center lies the Morgrad, containing the four elements earth, water, fire and air. It is the place of transience, [within which lies] the heart of the inexpressible darkness of Beliar. Above all this towers the sphere of the heavens.`
  - from book `Astronomy`
  - German: `Im Zentrum befindet sich der Morgrad mit seinen vier Elementen Erde, Wasser, Feuer und Luft, der Raum des Vergänglichen, in seinem Inneren die unaussprechliche Dunkelheit des Beliar. Über allem befindet sich die Sphäre des Himmels`
  - original English translation missed words `in seinem Inneren` (`within which lies`)
  - it made it appear like "Morgrad is the heart of darkness", rather than as the original text means, "the heart of darkness is deep inside Morgrad"
 
## Microcosm vs Macrocosm and unity of opposites
- `[Man] is a reflection of the world itself`
  - this refers to philosophical idea that microcosm ("small world", like human body) reflects macrocosm ("great world", the universe)
  - the same idea is metaphorically expressed in the 1803 real-world poem by William Blake: `see a World in a Grain of Sand`
- `His soul allows him to take part in (...) the divine spirit. Yet man's body is made from the substance of the Morgrad.`
  - this refers to philosophical idea of unity of opposites, which are connected and inseparable, neccessary for world to exist

## Three Spheres
- cosmos is divided into three "Spheres", with each surrounding the lower one:
- realm of darkness
  - `the heart of the inexpressible darkness of Beliar`
  - populated by spirits of the dead (and guarded by Beliar)
  - made of element of darkness
- realm of mortals
  - `In the center`, `place of transience`, `containing the four elements`
  - "transience" means short, temporary existence
  - populated by humans and animals
  - made of four elements `earth, water, fire and air`
- realm of heavens
  - `Above all this`, `the highest plane of existence`, `the divine`, `the Other Side`
  - populated by the gods (ruled by Innos?)
  - made of element of light (?)
 
## Heavens as the source of magic
- `magus' spirit rises above our sphere and gazes upon the Other Side, the home of power` (`The Secrets of Magic`)
- `magus has reached a stage which enables him to rise above the limits of his existence, he can place himself on a higher plane than that in which mortal man lives` (`True Power`)

## Other worlds
- `The synodic orbit of the planets, that is the course they take between two identical positions in relation to the Morgrad of our world`
  - German: `Die synodische Umlaufszeit der Planeten, dh. die Zeitdauer zwischen zwei gleichartigen Stellungen in Bezug zum Morgrad unserer Welt`, from book `Astronomy`
- expression `Morgrad of our world` (German: `Morgrad unserer Welt`) suggests there may be other worlds with similar structure, having realm of mortals halfway between realm of darkness and heavens

## Demon World
- accessible from portal in _Temple Of Sleeper_ and under the _Stone Circle Of The Damned_
- _arch demons_ live there and fight each other
- according to early designs, player was supposed to be able to enter it, or even accidentally help a demon enter the world of living
- `The demon world is a parallel dimension to which the player has only very limited access. The portals in the Ancient Temple lead through the demon world to the Outside World. The player moves along winding, predetermined paths that are cut off from the rest of the demon world by a magical barrier. If he looks through the magical protective barrier, he sees part of the demon world. He also sees some demons that would like to tear him to pieces, but cannot because of the protective barrier.`
  - from Phoenix Level Design docs
- `Later in the game the Demon Summoner will enable the PC [Player Character] to enter the Demon World (perhaps to get a powerful magical artifact)`
  - from Phoenix Level Design docs
- according to one miner, _Minecrawlers_ come from the realm of Baliar:
  - `Beware of the minecrawlers. (...) Those rotten creatures come directly from Beliar's realm!` (_Glen_, `VLK_583_Glen_INFO_Info`)
