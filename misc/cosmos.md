# The Cosmos

- `In the center lies the Morgrad, containing the four elements earth, water, fire and air. It is the place of transience, the heart of the inexpressible darkness of Beliar. Above all this towers the sphere of the heavens.`
  - from book `Astronomy`

## Demon World
- accessible from portal in _Temple Of Sleeper_ and under the _Stone Circle Of The Damned_
- _arch demons_ live there and fight each other
- according to early designs, player was supposed to be able to enter it, or even accidentally help a demon enter the world of living
- `The demon world is a parallel dimension to which the player has only very limited access. The portals in the Ancient Temple lead through the demon world to the Outside World. The player moves along winding, predetermined paths that are cut off from the rest of the demon world by a magical barrier. If he looks through the magical protective barrier, he sees part of the demon world. He also sees some demons that would like to tear him to pieces, but cannot because of the protective barrier.`

- `Later in the game the Demon Summoner will enable the PC [Player Character] to enter the Demon World (perhaps to get a powerful magical artifact)`
