title: Barrier
---

- great magic forcefield surrounding the whole `Mine Valley Of Khorinis`
- `whitish shimmering wall` (_Sleeper's Ban_)
- `gloomy, shimmering hemisphere, on the surface of which the light wavered, and worm-like movements could be seen, which seemed to change vaguely into structures` (_Sleeper's Ban_)
- `a perfect sphere ten miles in diameter` (_Sleeper's Ban_)
- `he stumbled towards the white of the barrier. The movements in it seemed to get faster and with horror he saw little white fingers of light stretching out in his direction, as if eager to take him` (_Sleeper's Ban_)
- was only supposed to surround the `Labor camp`, including prison and a nearby mine, but expanded due to magic anomaly
- due to Barrier's magic radiation inside is always warm
  - source: `Sleeper's Ban`
- trying to cross it from inside to outside causes incapacitating "madness" and eventually catatonic state
  - considered impenetrable by prisoners
  - `all the attempts to break trough it so far were for nothing` (_Sleeper's Ban_)
  - there are no signs that anyone is still trying to escape trough it
- `formed by the most powerful principals of the Mages Guild` (_Sleeper's Ban_)

In order to save his most precious mine in Khorinis,
where his people gathered magical Ore and forged them into the strongest weapons in the land,
King Rhotbar called together 12 of the most talented Mages of Myrtana...

He ordered them to erect a magical barrier around the Khorinis mining colony to stop the numerous escape attempts by the workers.
A barrier that let all life in but not out.
Together, the Twelve Magicians developed a magic formula to do this.

When the formula was ready, the Twelve Magicians set out to build the barrier.
With the help of five magical foci, which they set up according to a ritual pattern, they concentrated their power and spoke the words of the spell.

The bright winter sky grew gray and dark as thick storm clouds gathered and obscured the sun.
Lightning flashed darting across the sky.
Like a whirlwind the streams of magic energy united, as the mages cast the spell using the foci.
The sky turned black and a rising rumble suddenly erupted in exploding thunder.

And then she was there.
A blue-hazed sheet drove across the mine, passing the boundaries of will.
Over a vast area, much larger than previously calculated, the barrier stretched across the land like a gigantic dome.
Thousand metres in diameter, stretches over the prison reaching through the underground and meeting to a perfect sphere in the depths of the mines.
```

```
On the other side of the cliff you see the enormous shimmering dome, that you saw from afar, now towering above you.
Stunned, you stand gaping at the vastness of the barrier, frozen in a moment of horror.
The dark humming hardly noticeable before, is now clearer and louder.
```

```
Without Sruup you will go just as insane as when you approach the barrier.
You have to understand that this damned wall that surrounds us can only be crossed once and in one direction.
You can completely forget about getting from the inside to the outside; anyone who comes closer than a step falls over, starts screaming and drooling like a newborn child.
When you pull them out, they slowly recover.
Those who weren't taken away in time, went permanently insane.
They just screech, shit themselves and are incapable of any sensible action until they go to Kasakk's realm at some point, simply because they forget to eat, breathe, drink or whatever.
```

```
The damn light here is always constant.
There will be no day, no night, the light is always the same, the temperature is always the same; that too makes this damned barrier.
```

## Labor camp
- made of few `magic ore` mines, small underground ironworks and a fortified prison
- originally meant for `the scum of society: assassins, highwaymen, murderers, rapists and insurgents` (_Sleeper's Ban_)
- king sentences for lifetime in there even for being unable to pay taxes, and imports convicts from entire kingdom
- `only a few news of what goes around inside there are known. Sometimes some rumors can be heard, but for some reason, the king, and the Lords of Khorinis keep all this information secret, so only a few know what's happening there.`
- `My shed was as empty as my stomach, and I just couldn't pay. So one day the soldiers came and brought me here. (...) I'd always paid my taxes before - all my life. But that wasn't good enough for that son of a bitch with the crown!`
- _Milten_ didn't hear about _Prison Colony Of Khorinis_ until he was arrested right there
  - he travelled to Khorinis because he actually thought it is a safe place for a deserter to stay _away_ from royal attention
