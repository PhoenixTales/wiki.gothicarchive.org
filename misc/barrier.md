title: Barrier

```
King Rhotbar chose to take desperate measures... THE BARRIER...
```

```
In order to save his most precious mine in Khorinis,
where his people gathered magical Ore and forged them into the strongest weapons in the land,
King Rhotbar called together 12 of the most talented Mages of Myrtana...

He ordered them to erect a magical barrier around the Khorinis mining colony to stop the numerous escape attempts by the workers.
A barrier that let all life in but not out.
Together, the Twelve Magicians developed a magic formula to do this.

When the formula was ready, the Twelve Magicians set out to build the barrier.
With the help of five magical foci, which they set up according to a ritual pattern, they concentrated their power and spoke the words of the spell.

The bright winter sky grew gray and dark as thick storm clouds gathered and obscured the sun.
Lightning flashed darting across the sky.
Like a whirlwind the streams of magic energy united, as the mages cast the spell using the foci.
The sky turned black and a rising rumble suddenly erupted in exploding thunder.

And then she was there.
A blue-hazed sheet drove across the mine, passing the boundaries of will.
Over a vast area, much larger than previously calculated, the barrier stretched across the land like a gigantic dome.
Thousand metres in diameter, stretches over the prison reaching through the underground and meeting to a perfect sphere in the depths of the mines.
```

```
On the other side of the cliff you see the enormous shimmering dome, that you saw from afar, now towering above you.
Stunned, you stand gaping at the vastness of the barrier, frozen in a moment of horror.
The dark humming hardly noticeable before, is now clearer and louder.
