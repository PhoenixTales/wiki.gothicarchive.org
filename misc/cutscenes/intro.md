## Screenplay

The kingdom of Myrtana, united by king Rhobar II.

(THE THRONE ROOM; THE KING SITS ON THE THRONE)

During the long years of his reign, he was able to defeat all foes of his realm... all except one.

(A BATTLEFIELD; ORCS TRIUMPH OVER HUMAN SOLDIERS, FIRES ARE RAGING)

(INSIDE A MINE; ARMORED GUARDS OVERSEE THE MINERS)

The war against the orcs took its toll, and the prisoners of the realm were to pay the price.

The king needed swords for his army, and every man guilty of a crime, no matter how insignificant, was forced to work in the ore mines of Khorinis.

(THE MOUNTAIN PASS; A PROCESSION OF CHAINED PRISONERS OVERSEEN BY ARMORED GUARDS WALKS TOWARDS THE MINE VALLEY)

To make it impossible for them to escape, the king sent out the best magicians of the kingdom to create a magic barrier around the entire valley. I was one of them.

(THE MINE VALLEY; THE HOODED MAGE CASTS A SPELL, A MAGIC BARRIER STARTS TO EXPAND FROM THE CENTER OF THE VALLEY)

Something disturbed the delicate structure of magic. We were trapped inside our own barrier.

(THE BARRIER KEEPS EXPANDING UNTIL IT SURROUNDS THE ENTIRE VALLEY, INCLUDING THE HOODED MAGE)

(THE PRISON COURTYARD; PRISONERS SUDDENLY MURDER THE CONFUSED PRISON GUARDS USING PICKAXES AND DAGGERS)

One second of negligence was enough for the prisoners. Khorinis was now under the control of the convicts. 

(THE THRONE ROOM; KING HANDS A SEALED SCROLL TO A SOLDIER)

The king had no choice, he had to negotiate, he needed the ore.

(THE EDGE OF THE BARRIER; A PERSON ON THE ELEVATED OUTER SIDE THROWS THE SEALED SCROLL TO A PERSON INSIDE)

(THE EDGE OF THE BARRIER, DAYS LATER; ON THE ELEVATED OUTER SIDE WORKERS PLACE GOODS INTO A LIFT MECHANISM; THERE'S A TIED, BARELY CLOTHED WOMAN SITTING THERE TOO; THE LIFT IS LOWERED INTO THE BARRIER)

Month after month the king supplied everything the prisoners needed. Month after month they brought the ore to the edge of the barrier in exchange, until the present day.

(THE EDGE OF THE BARRIER, YEARS LATER; ON THE ELEVATED OUTER SIDE THE NEW CONVICT IS BROUGHT BY TWO ROYAL GUARDS, ACCOMPANIED BY A PRISON GUARD AND THE JUDGE)

Another convict was brought to the cliff. He did not know, but he would change everything.

THE JUDGE: In the name of king Rhobar II, bearer of the scepter of Varant, I sentence this convict to...

(THE HIGH MAGE OF FIRE SUDDENLY WALKS INTO THE SCENE)

THE HIGH MAGE OF FIRE: Stop! Convict, I've got an offer to make you: this letter must reach the leader of the Magicians of Fire.

THE NEW CONVICT: You're wasting your time.

THE HIGH MAGE OF FIRE: You may choose your own reward, they'll give you anything you ask for.

THE NEW CONVICT: Very well, I'll take your letter... on one condition: spare me the rest of his nonsense.

THE JUDGE: How dare you!

THE HIGH MAGE OF FIRE: Keep silent! Right, send him in.

(TWO ROYAL GUARDS PUSH THE NEW CONVICT DOWN THE CLIFF, MAKING HIM FALL TROUGH THE BARRIER INTO A SMALL LAKE, THE NEW CONVICT CRAWLS OUT OF THE WATER ON THE OTHER SIDE, WHERE THREE BRUTAL PRISONERS AWAIT)

THE BRUTAL PRISONER: Welcome to the colony.

(THE BRUTAL PRISONER KNOCKS OUT THE NEW CONVICT, THE FRIENDLY PRISONER ENTERS THE SCENE)

THE FRIENDLY PRISONER: That's enough, leave him alone. And now scram. 

(THREE BRUTAL PRISONERS LEAVE)

THE FRIENDLY PRISONER: Get up.
