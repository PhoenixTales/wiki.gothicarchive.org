## Archdemons
- `There are a total of seven "Sleepers" in the World Of Demons. Six of them are still there (...) and one has been banished to "our" world.`
  - from Phoenix Level Design docs
- `Sleeper is a Demon Lord. And a Demon Lord behaves towards normal Demons like a human behaves towards animals. Problem: normal Demons are far superior to normal humans, but the Sleeper...`
  - from Phoenix Level Design docs

## National religion of Myrtana
- three gods are worshipped
  - `the man of the three gods, and governor of the highest god`
  - `Pray for the last time to your gods` (alpha threat from a _Sect Novice_)
  - `The gods will be with me` (`Journal Page` of `a troll hunter`)
- but not considered almighty
  - `faith in divine omnipotence soon became a myth`
- expression `Oh, Ancient Gods` in `Chromanin III` may suggest that the ancient times had gods different than current times
  - it also shows that the book author somehow still knew or remembered about those replaced gods
  - German: `Oh, ihr Götter der alten Zeiten` / `Oh, you Gods of the ancient Times`

## Priests
-  _Priests of Innos_ are members of _House of Innos_ 
  - some of the _Priests of Innos_ are members of the _Circle of Fire_ and known as _Alchemists of Fire_ or _Fire Mages_
 
## Ra, God Of The Sun
- king of Myrtana is `governor of the highest god, Ra`
- as suggested by `OtWaMaskSun.tga`, symbolized by bright yellow 8-armed star, which according to file name is the Sun
- does not appear in the final release of the game, mostly replaced with _Innos_

## Innos, God Of Fire
- `The god of light, truth and justice`
- `Innos, the highest of all gods` (_Corristo_ in `KDF_402_Corristo_EXPLAINMAGE_Info`)
- as suggested by `OtWaMaskFire.tga`, symbolized by red flame
- `KDF_40_VlkSpeech`: `Follow the way of mana, and all will be saved. Otherwise the earth will burn.`
- `Innos, the god of light` (_Baal Taran_)
- there's a sword called _Innos' Rage_
- `I am the rising sun, the light, and the life`
- `Innos appeared and his light shone upon the world. And Innos gave unto the world the gift of life. But no creature could live in the light of Innos, so he created the sun.`
- `Innos divided himself and thus created Beliar`, `Innos divided himself again and created Adanos.`
- Innos `decided to leave mankind in the care of Adanos, and he rested`
- `Innos gave mankind the power to hear him and speak to him. He gave mankind the power to perform great miracles, and he called them magic`
- blessings: `May Innos watch over you!` (_Torrez_), `May Innos protect us all` (_Letter to the Magicians of Fire_)

### Other games
- Gothic 3 suggests that faith in Innos originally was brought to _Nordmar_ in ancient times from South by _Akasha_, and in recent past from _Nordmar_ to _Midlands_ by _Rhobar I_:
- `A very long time ago, a man came to Nordmar. A man inspired by the fire of Innos. He came from far away, from the south. He became one of us, a Nordmarian. This man was Akascha. Some Nordmarians were convinced that Akascha got his strength from Innos. They followed him and started to pray to Innos. These people left their clans in order to found a new clan with Akascha. A clan that follows Innos. This is how the Fire Clan came to be.`
- `The barbarians lived in Nordmar. And Rhobar was one of them. (...) And Innos said to Rhobar: Descend from the mountains, and defeat my enemies. And Rhobar waged war against the orcs. And the wrath of Innos descended upon them. And Rhobar was victorious. Once his enemies were defeated, Innos said to him: This is where you shall establish your kingdom. And Rhobar did as he was bidden.`
- Gothic 3 also tells that _Innos_ wanted to physically enter the world of mortals trough a `portal` to directly unleash his full power there (similarly like it almost happened with _The Sleeper_) but was stopped by _Beliar_ and _Adanos_
  - `And Innos spoke to his servants: 'Erect a portal for me, so that I might reign over this world in all eternity!' And his servants did as they were bidden. But when Beliar saw what the servants of Innos were doing, he screamed with rage. (...) And Adanos called a flood (...) And Adanos said to his brothers: 'Never more shall you set foot in my land.'`

## Adanos, God Of Water
- before called _Cyvanis_
- patron of healing, work, knowledge, curiosity, courage
- `The words Cyvanis: Work and live, for the day is made for man to work. Look for learning and knowledge so that you can pass it on`
- `Adanos brought man versatility, knowledge, curiosity and courage`
- `god Adanos, who is the balance between good and evil`
- `Adanos (...) spoke: (...) I shall give mankind the power of healing.`
- `Work and live, for the day was created so that man may work. Seek learning and knowledge so that you may pass it on, for it is for that purpose that you were created.` (book `Words of the Gods`)
- as suggested by `OtWaMaskWater.tga`, symbolized by light blue droplet
- `many who soon became dissatisfied [with Innos]. And so it happened that they prayed to Adanos and forgot their origins. The league of priests was divided. Wars ensued and the faith in divine omnipotence soon became a myth. And so the priests were separated.`
- greeting: `May the blessing of Adanos be with you` (_Cronos_)

## Beliar, God of Darkness
- before called _Vandras_
- patron of punishment, night, shadows, death
- `Beliar created the night`
- `he created death and ended the lives of men`
- `until my body shall return to the realm of Beliar and the fire of my life be extinguished`
- `the mightiest spell of the Fifth Circle is the Ripple of Death. (...) Be careful to use this kind of magic as little as possible. It's a gift from the god of darkness.`
- as suggested by `OtWaMaskMoon.tga`, symbolized by crescent moon on dark purple
- `humans died and it was the will of Beliar that it should be that way` (from book `The Second Circle`)
- `whosoever shall do wrong and go against the will of the gods, him I will punish. I will plague his body with pain, suffering and death, but his spirit shall join me in the shadows forever more.` (book `Words of the Gods`)
- book `Words of the Gods` says that Beliar `created a man, a man to pray to him alone`, but after seeing that `the man he created was like all other men` (did not worship him), `Beliar became so furious that he killed the man` and said `If they will not worship me, then at least they shall fear me`
- `inexpressible darkness of Beliar` (book `Astronomy`)
- `Beliar became so furious` (book `Words of the Gods`)

## Archdemon Sleeper
- in early design docs mentioned as `The Being` (German: `der Wesenheit`) (see `NPCs per guild`)
- `The Sleeper(...)has been sleeping for a thousand years, but now the moment of his awakening is near.`
- `He has chosen us to be witnesses to his awakening and to spread his word. So listen, all those who join the Sleeper will have immortal souls, but those who are against him will be punished.`
- `Sleeper comes from the Demon Realm. He is something like a demigod there`
  - German: `Auch der Schläfer stammt aus dem Dämonenreich. Ist dort sowas wie ein Halbgott.`
  - Source: `Phoenix-Konzept`, chapter on monster design
- there are 7 arch demons in total, that fight between each other for dominance
- `The creation of the Magic Barrier awakened something.` (`Inf_Mst_MB`)
  - German: `Die Erschaffung der Magische Barriere hat irgendetwas erwachen lassen`
- his `goal is to awaken in order to enslave people` (design doc `Story 3.3 draft`)
- also called `Krushak`, already in early design docs (`Story 3.3 draft`)
- `when Krushak awakens and distributes his power among the mortals who have served him loyally from the beginning` (`Story 3.3 draft`)
- according to _Y'Berion_, awakening The Sleeper `will cause the magical barrier to burst` (`Story 3.3 draft`)
- `The Sleeper can use more powerful versions of the learnable spells`
  - `they might kill each other (Sleeper's Rage spell)`
  - from Phoenix Level Design docs
- `The Sleeper only wants to gather enough energy to a) open a portal back to his world and b) create enough undead that will then help him show the other six [archdemons] what's what...`
  - from Phoenix Level Design docs
- initial sketch of the final confrontation didn't mention Shaman hearts and instead involved `opening the portal and sending the Sleeper back`
  - German: `das Portal öffnen und den Schläfer zurückschicken` (in `Phoenix Hauptmissionen`)
- defeating the Sleeper would not automatically "clean up" all the demons, undead and insanity released by him in the last chapter
  - `The player leaves the temple/orc city through all the demons and crazy people (...) leaves the colony -> end of the game`, `After the Sleeper is defeated, everyone is dead. OC is occupied by demons, undead, etc.`
  - `Der Spieler verläßt durch alle Dämonen und durchgedrehten Leute den Tempel/Orkstadt, (...) verläßt dann irgendwann die Kolonie -> Spielende.`, `Nach dem der Schläfer besiegt ist, sind alle tot. OC ist von Dämonen, Untoten usw. besetzt.`
  - source: `Phoenix Hauptmissionen`
 
## Human soul
- `[Man's] soul allows him to take part in the highest plane of existence, the divine spirit.`

## Shugul Sath
- also known as the _Smoke Hunter_
- also known as the _Shadow Walker_, which in the alpha scripts is used as codename for the _Shadowbeast_, suggesting that _Shadowbeast_ might have originated as the animal form of _Shugul Sath_
- can take human form of _The Old Man_
- `Some think that it is an ancient being that has roamed the cosmos for millennia, and that just happened to be trapped in this barrier on its way around the world`
- appears as giant black panther with yellow glowing eyes
- can gradually change into smoke and back, and walk trough the stone
  - `The creature turned its head and stared at the wall, where yellowish glimmer of light started to appear. It walked towards this glow and then without stopping, as if it was natural, disappeared into the rock with a soft hissing movement.`
- can speak (`he heard that muffled, rumbling voice "Use the gift of the rock spray!"`)
- possibly only visible to those it wants to be visible to, and invisible to others
- in `Sleeper's Ban` it saved Stomp (prototype of the Nameless Hero) from attackers who were going to murder him just after he was imprisoned
```
And again he heard this rumbling and hissing, which came from the creature, but also seemed to echo from the ground below and from the rock next to him: "Keep the grace period!".
As if through a fog, he perceived that the being had spoken!
And while he was still trying to cope with this realization, he heard loud screams of flight of his attackers.  
He looked back, and realized that they are all gone.
```
```
He saw a large, almost man-high shadow that moved slowly, quietly through the forest floor.
It reminded of a dog or something, just a lot bigger than anything Stomp had seen in his life. 
It was a dark shape, with no visible details, dominated by a pair of bright yellow eyes
```
```
It was taller, taller than any carnivore he had ever seen in the circus, taller than any panther he had ever seen, although that species was the most similar in stature. 
```
```
where the finger-long claws touched the rock, the stone itself seemed to boil, flow like water in waves around the plate-sized paws.
Most terrifying, however, were the eyes; they had no irises, they had no pupils, the entire outlines seemed to be filled with yellow light shining like the sun, with gaze focused on the group.
Then the creature opened its mouth and Stomp saw finger-length, needle-sharp teeth and when the creature closed its jaws with a loud click, he found that the canines protruded almost a hand's span over the lower lip.
In his fear it seemed as if yellow light was also shining from the beast's maw.
```
```
He saw a dark cloud between two hanging roots.
At first he thought it was smoke from his torch; However, as he watched the whole thing longer, this cloud thickened and took the shape of a large cat, which, he couldn't believe his eyes, was sitting upside down on the ceiling.
The already familiar eye openings began to glow, and between long, shiny fangs he saw the yellow shimmer flashing from the creature's maw.
She sat there, upside down, on the ceiling high above him, just as calm and composed as if she were crouching on the floor in front of him.
The massive skull twisted and the yellow lights fixed on his astonished face.
```
```
There was a strange aroma in the air, smoky, sweet. He'd smelled that smell before, but couldn't tell when or where.
```

## Kasakk
- only mentioned in _Sleeper's Ban_, and the only deity appearing there
- appears to be the deity of the realm of the dead, similarly to _Beliar_ from the final game release
  - `until they go to Kasakk's realm at some point, simply because they forget to eat or breathe or drink or whatever`
- despite being a dark god, he appears to be the only one worshipped by people in the story, drawing parallel with _Crom_ from universe of _Conan The Barbarian_
- `in Kasakk's name, leave me alone please!`
- `thank Kasakk they are not organized`
- `He really deserved it, in Kasakk's name`
- `Kasakk put copper on the eyes of three of our men` (they died) 
- `by Kasakk's stinking heap!`
- `for Kasakk's sake, let's get out of here`
- `Kasakk, Kasakk? Right, there was this little god, I remember`
