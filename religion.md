## Shugul Sath
- also known as the Smoke Hunter
- `Some think that it is an ancient being that has roamed the cosmos for millennia, and that just happened to be trapped in this barrier on its way around the world`
- appears as giant black panther with yellow glowing eyes
- can gradually change into smoke and back, and walk trough the stone
  - `The creature turned its head and stared at the wall, where yellowish glimmer of light started to appear. It walked towards this glow and then without stopping, as if it was natural, disappeared into the rock with a soft hissing movement.`
- can speak (`he heard that muffled, rumbling voice "Use the gift of the rock spray!"`)
- possibly only visible to those it wants to be visible to, and invisible to others
  - 
- in `Sleeper's Ban` it saved Stomp (prototype of the Nameless Hero) from attackers who were going to murder him just after he was imprisoned
```
And again he heard this rumbling and hissing, which came from the creature, but also seemed to echo from the ground below and from the rock next to him: "Keep the grace period!".
As if through a fog, he perceived that the being had spoken!
And while he was still trying to cope with this realization, he heard loud screams of flight of his attackers.  
He looked back, and realized that they are all gone.
```
```
He saw a large, almost man-high shadow that moved slowly, quietly through the forest floor.
It reminded of a dog or something, just a lot bigger than anything Stomp had seen in his life. 
It was a dark shape, with no visible details, dominated by a pair of bright yellow eyes
```
```
She was taller, taller than any carnivore he had ever seen in the circus, taller than any panther he had ever seen, although that species was the most similar in stature. 
```
```
where the finger-long claws touched the rock, the stone itself seemed to boil, flow like water in waves around the plate-sized paws.
Most terrifying, however, were the eyes; they had no irises, they had no pupils, the entire outlines seemed to be filled with yellow light shining like the sun, with gaze focused on the group.
Then the creature opened its mouth and Stomp saw finger-length, needle-sharp teeth and when the creature closed its jaws with a loud click, he found that the canines protruded almost a hand's span over the lower lip.
In his fear it seemed as if yellow light was also shining from the beast's maw.
```
```
He saw a dark cloud between two hanging roots.
At first he thought it was smoke from his torch; However, as he watched the whole thing longer, this cloud thickened and took the shape of a large cat, which, he couldn't believe his eyes, was sitting upside down on the ceiling.
The already familiar eye openings began to glow, and between long, shiny fangs he saw the yellow shimmer flashing from the creature's maw.
She sat there, upside down, on the ceiling high above him, just as calm and composed as if she were crouching on the floor in front of him.
The massive skull twisted and the yellow lights fixed on his astonished face.
```
```
There was a strange aroma in the air, smoky, sweet. He'd smelled that smell before, but couldn't tell when or where.
```

## Kasakk
- only mentioned in _Sleeper's Ban_
- appears to be the deity of the realm of the dead, similarly to _Beliar_ from the final game release
  - `until they go to Kasakk's realm at some point, simply because they forget to eat or breathe or drink or whatever`
- mentioned by the convicts, including main character, way more often than any other deity
- `in Kasakk's name, let me kindly all alone!`
- `thank Kasakk they are not organized`
- `He really deserved it, in Kasakk's name`
- `Kasakk put copper on the eyes of three of our men` (they died) 
- `by Kasakk's stinking heap!`
- `for Kasakk's sake, let's get out of here`
- `Kasakk, Kasakk? Right, there was this little god, I remember`
