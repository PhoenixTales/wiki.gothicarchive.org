## National religion of Myrtana
- three gods are worshipped
  - `the man of the three gods, and governor of the highest god`
  - `Pray for the last time to your gods` (alpha threat from a _Sect Novice_)
- but not considered almighty
  - `faith in divine omnipotence soon became a myth`

## Priests
-  _Priests of Innos_ are members of _House of Innos_ 
  - some of the _Priests of Innos_ are members of the _Circle of Fire_ and known as _Alchemists of Fire_ or _Fire Mages_
 
## Ra, God Of The Sun
- `I am the rising sun, the light, and the life`
- king of Myrtana is `governor of the highest god, Ra`
- as suggested by `OtWaMaskSun.tga`, symbolized by bright yellow 8-armed star
- does not appear in the final release of the game, mostly replaced with _Innos_
  - final in-game texts mention spells mentioned above as belonging to either element of `fire` or `water` instead of the `sun`

## Innos, God Of Fire
- `The god of light, truth and justice`
- `Innos, the highest of all gods`
- as suggested by `OtWaMaskFire.tga`, symbolized by red flame
- `KDF_40_VlkSpeech`: `Follow the way of mana, and all will be saved. Otherwise the earth will burn.`

### Other games
- Gothic 3 suggests that faith in Innos originally was brought to _Nordmar_ in ancient times from South by _Akasha_, and in recent past from _Nordmar_ to _Midlands_ by _Rhobar I_:
- `A very long time ago, a man came to Nordmar. A man inspired by the fire of Innos. He came from far away, from the south. He became one of us, a Nordmarian. This man was Akascha. Some Nordmarians were convinced that Akascha got his strength from Innos. They followed him and started to pray to Innos. These people left their clans in order to found a new clan with Akascha. A clan that follows Innos. This is how the Fire Clan came to be.`
- `The barbarians lived in Nordmar. And Rhobar was one of them. (...) And Innos said to Rhobar: Descend from the mountains, and defeat my enemies. And Rhobar waged war against the orcs. And the wrath of Innos descended upon them. And Rhobar was victorious. Once his enemies were defeated, Innos said to him: This is where you shall establish your kingdom. And Rhobar did as he was bidden.`
- Gothic 3 also suggests that _Innos_ wanted to physically enter the world of mortals trough a `portal` so that he no longer needs to struggle for "remote control" over it with other gods, but was stopped by _Beliar_ and _Adanos_
  - `And Innos spoke to his servants: Erect a portal for me, so that I might reign over this world in all eternity! And his servants did as they were bidden. But when Beliar saw what the servants of Innos were doing, he screamed with rage. (...) And Adanos called a flood (...) And Adanos said to his brothers: Never more shall you set foot in my land.`

## Adanos, God Of Water
- before called _Cyvanis_
- patron of healing, work, knowledge, curiosity, courage
- `The words Cyvanis: Work and live, for the day is made for man to work. Look for learning and knowledge so that you can pass it on`
- `Adanos brought man versatility, knowledge, curiosity and courage`
- `god Adanos, who is the balance between good and evil`
- as suggested by `OtWaMaskWater.tga`, symbolized by light blue droplet

## Beliar, God of Darkness
- before called _Vandras_
- patron of punishment, night, shadows, death
- `Beliar created the night`
- `he created death and ended the lives of men`
- `spirit shall join me in the shadows forever more`
- `until my body shall return to the realm of Beliar and the fire of my life be extinguished`
- `the mightiest spell of the Fifth Circle is the Ripple of Death. (...) Be careful to use this kind of magic as little as possible. It's a gift from the god of darkness.`
- as suggested by `OtWaMaskMoon.tga`, symbolized by crescent moon on dark purple

## Archdemon Sleeper
- in early design docs mentioned as `The Being` (German: `der Wesenheit`) (see `NPCs per guild`)
- `The Sleeper(...)has been sleeping for a thousand years, but now the moment of his awakening is near.`
- `He has chosen us to be witnesses to his awakening and to spread his word. So listen, all those who join the Sleeper will have immortal souls, but those who are against him will be punished.`
- there are 7 arch demons in total, that fight between each other for dominance
- `The creation of the Magic Barrier awakened something.` (`Inf_Mst_MB`)
  - German: `Die Erschaffung der Magische Barriere hat irgendetwas erwachen lassen`
- his `goal is to awaken in order to enslave people` (design doc `Story 3.3 draft`)
- also called `Krushak`, already in early design docs (`Story 3.3 draft`)
- `when Krushak awakens and distributes his power among the mortals who have served him loyally from the beginning` (`Story 3.3 draft`)
- according to _Y'Berion_, awakening The Sleeper `will cause the magical barrier to burst` (`Story 3.3 draft`)

## Shugul Sath
- also known as the Smoke Hunter
- `Some think that it is an ancient being that has roamed the cosmos for millennia, and that just happened to be trapped in this barrier on its way around the world`
- appears as giant black panther with yellow glowing eyes
- can gradually change into smoke and back, and walk trough the stone
  - `The creature turned its head and stared at the wall, where yellowish glimmer of light started to appear. It walked towards this glow and then without stopping, as if it was natural, disappeared into the rock with a soft hissing movement.`
- can speak (`he heard that muffled, rumbling voice "Use the gift of the rock spray!"`)
- possibly only visible to those it wants to be visible to, and invisible to others
- in `Sleeper's Ban` it saved Stomp (prototype of the Nameless Hero) from attackers who were going to murder him just after he was imprisoned
```
And again he heard this rumbling and hissing, which came from the creature, but also seemed to echo from the ground below and from the rock next to him: "Keep the grace period!".
As if through a fog, he perceived that the being had spoken!
And while he was still trying to cope with this realization, he heard loud screams of flight of his attackers.  
He looked back, and realized that they are all gone.
```
```
He saw a large, almost man-high shadow that moved slowly, quietly through the forest floor.
It reminded of a dog or something, just a lot bigger than anything Stomp had seen in his life. 
It was a dark shape, with no visible details, dominated by a pair of bright yellow eyes
```
```
It was taller, taller than any carnivore he had ever seen in the circus, taller than any panther he had ever seen, although that species was the most similar in stature. 
```
```
where the finger-long claws touched the rock, the stone itself seemed to boil, flow like water in waves around the plate-sized paws.
Most terrifying, however, were the eyes; they had no irises, they had no pupils, the entire outlines seemed to be filled with yellow light shining like the sun, with gaze focused on the group.
Then the creature opened its mouth and Stomp saw finger-length, needle-sharp teeth and when the creature closed its jaws with a loud click, he found that the canines protruded almost a hand's span over the lower lip.
In his fear it seemed as if yellow light was also shining from the beast's maw.
```
```
He saw a dark cloud between two hanging roots.
At first he thought it was smoke from his torch; However, as he watched the whole thing longer, this cloud thickened and took the shape of a large cat, which, he couldn't believe his eyes, was sitting upside down on the ceiling.
The already familiar eye openings began to glow, and between long, shiny fangs he saw the yellow shimmer flashing from the creature's maw.
She sat there, upside down, on the ceiling high above him, just as calm and composed as if she were crouching on the floor in front of him.
The massive skull twisted and the yellow lights fixed on his astonished face.
```
```
There was a strange aroma in the air, smoky, sweet. He'd smelled that smell before, but couldn't tell when or where.
```

## Kasakk
- only mentioned in _Sleeper's Ban_, and the only deity appearing there
- appears to be the deity of the realm of the dead, similarly to _Beliar_ from the final game release
  - `until they go to Kasakk's realm at some point, simply because they forget to eat or breathe or drink or whatever`
- despite being a dark god, he appears to be the only one worshipped by people in the story, drawing parallel with _Crom_ from universe of _Conan The Barbarian_
- `in Kasakk's name, leave me alone please!`
- `thank Kasakk they are not organized`
- `He really deserved it, in Kasakk's name`
- `Kasakk put copper on the eyes of three of our men` (they died) 
- `by Kasakk's stinking heap!`
- `for Kasakk's sake, let's get out of here`
- `Kasakk, Kasakk? Right, there was this little god, I remember`
