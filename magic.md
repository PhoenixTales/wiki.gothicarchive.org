## Mages
- wielder of magic is sometimes called "magus" or "artist of arcane power"
- spells: light, petrify, heal, turn to animal, invisibility, stop time, telekinesis, control, insanity
- `The magicians consider themselves to be the chosen ones - and that's how they treat others.`
- `Magic is(...)A healing power that only a few chosen ones are able to control`
- `Our magic is a gift from the gods. We've been chosen to act as priests, tutors and judges. It is a gift which is a constant burden to us. A task which determines our lives.`

## Magic Ore
- naturally stores certain amount of magic energy
- violently explosive when hit with fireball
- used for making the famous alloy known as __steel of Khorinis__, considered the best in entire __Myrtana__
- known since ancient times, used by "Kings and heroes of old"
- `The magic ore does have special qualities. Weapons forged from it don't break, their blades are sharper than usual ones.`
- `the magic powers of the ore vanish during the smelting process`
- `The best ore(...)is(...)in the ore mines of Khorinis.(...)A weapon forged from this steel(...)`

### Speculation
- explosion in contact with fireball can be explained by explosiveness of the magic ore itself, or by instantly transferring all of the ore's energy into the spell making contact with it

## Rune Stones
- common spells are cast with __rune stones__
- `holds a glowing stone in his hand, which is about as big as a fist`
- `I thought of using this Focus stone I recently bought`
- `Each rune contains the structure of a special magic spell. By using your own magic powers, you'll be able to cast the magic of the rune. But in contrast to the magic scrolls, which are magic formulas as well, the magic power of the rune ensures that the structure of the spell endures. Every rune is a source of magic power which you can fall back on anytime. Your own magic power is used up when you use a rune, just as with a spell scroll.`
- `The magic of the runes is based on the stone. They are magic stones, created out of magic ore. It's the same ore which is collected in the mines. This ore is endowed with magic formulas in the temples. (...)With the runes you control now, you have the entire knowledge of the temples of the realm at your fingertips.`
- `Many have learnt the language of the runes, but only very few understand their magic.`

## Swamp weed
- smokable weed growing on swamps
- relaxes, increases magic powers
- makes most people able to cast at least simple spells
- large amounts can bring visions from demons
- if addicted, long depravation can bring insanity

## Focus Stone
- crystal-based energy storage device
- much easier to release than charge
- can be used to cast "high magic" spells, like giant force-fields or explosions able to destroy such force-fields
- casting a spell with focus stone uses magic power from the stone, not (only) from the mage

### Speculation
- possibly magically explosive when charged
- possibly changes color depending on current energy:
  - from gray-transparent (like on Discharged Uriziel)
  - trough color of water battle (like partially(?) discharged Focus Stones of mine valley)
  - to intense dark blue (like on charged Uriziel)

## Uriziel
- sword powerful enough to harm, but not kill, arch demon
- `Uriziel das Grosse` and `Mythrilklinge`
- `It's a weapon from the olden days, when the human race was still young.`
- `The weapon was forged from an unknown material. And there's nothing written about who created it!`
- can be used to make a rune that `has Beliar's powers` called `Wave of Death`
- `Ancient runes have been engraved into the blade`
- `the ancient powers of the sword URIZIEL`
- `This ancient blade supposedly had immense powers`
- `the weapon was able to pierce the strongest armor and to overcome even the most powerful of protection spells.`
- `the Orcs took it from a powerful warlord.`
- was wielded by __ancient general__ in battle against orcs
- `This sword is forged from a noble ore by dwarves who were master craftsmen`
  - `Dieses Schwert ist aus einem edelen Erz geschmiedet, von Zwergen, die ihr Handwerk meisterlich verstanden`

## Magic Ore Armor
- `ore armor (...) belonged to the general who wielded URIZIEL in the battle against the Orcs.`
- `This ancient armor was made of magic ore`

## Stone Circle of the Damned / Resurrection Stone
- has the power to return the dead to life or turn them to undead zombies
