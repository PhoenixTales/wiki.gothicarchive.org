## Mages
- wielder of magic is sometimes called "magus" or "artist of arcane power"
- spells: light, petrify, heal, turn to animal, invisibility, stop time, telekinesis, control, insanity
- `The magicians consider themselves to be the chosen ones - and that's how they treat others.`
- `Magic is(...)A healing power that only a few chosen ones are able to control`
- `Our magic is a gift from the gods. We've been chosen to act as priests, tutors and judges. It is a gift which is a constant burden to us. A task which determines our lives.`

## Magic Ore
- naturally stores certain amount of magic energy
- violently explosive when hit with fireball
- used for making the famous alloy known as _steel of Khorinis_, considered the best in entire _Myrtana_
- known since ancient times, used by "Kings and heroes of old"
- `The magic ore does have special qualities. Weapons forged from it don't break, their blades are sharper than usual ones.`
- `the magic powers of the ore vanish during the smelting process`
- `The best ore(...)is(...)in the ore mines of Khorinis.(...)A weapon forged from this steel(...)`

## Rune Stones
- common spells are cast with _rune stones_
- `holds a glowing stone in his hand, which is about as big as a fist`
- `I thought of using this Focus stone I recently bought`
- `Each rune contains the structure of a special magic spell. By using your own magic powers, you'll be able to cast the magic of the rune. But in contrast to the magic scrolls, which are magic formulas as well, the magic power of the rune ensures that the structure of the spell endures. Every rune is a source of magic power which you can fall back on anytime. Your own magic power is used up when you use a rune, just as with a spell scroll.`
- `The magic of the runes is based on the stone. They are magic stones, created out of magic ore. It's the same ore which is collected in the mines. This ore is endowed with magic formulas in the temples. (...)With the runes you control now, you have the entire knowledge of the temples of the realm at your fingertips.`
- `Many have learnt the language of the runes, but only very few understand their magic.`
