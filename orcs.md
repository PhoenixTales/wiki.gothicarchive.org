title: Orcs
---

- orc army arrived from the _Northern Plains_
  - `the kingdom is at war with the northern hordes`
  - `Soon they would have reached the end of the northern plains and overrun our little outpost with ease`
- orcs live in underground cities
  - `Deep beneath the Free Mine live large, dangerous creatures called orcs.`
- orcs bury their dead in underground tombs
  - `The Orcs used to bury their dead there, that's why we call this system of caves the Orc cemetery.`
- there are orcs living in the south-west of the _Royal Ore Mines_ around _Khorinis_
- humans are using orc slaves, orcs used to do the same with humans in the past
- orcs are similarly developed as humans, but in different ways
  - `Orcs are not animals, as many people think`, `Their culture is as old as the human culture.`
- there are orc shamans wielding magic
  - `son of the spirit. People call shaman.`
- there was an orc culture centuries or millenium ago around _Khorinis_
  - they were at war with someone
  - they somehow got acces to dimensional portal and summoned an _arch demon_
  - they had human slaves
  - `few centuries ago, five Orc shamen invoked a very old arch demon`
    - `which they hoped would give their clan the power to defeat their enemies.`
    - `in an uknown ancient temple, unchanged for 1000 years`
- the orcs have ancient prophecies
  - `Ancient Orcish documents written shortly after the sealing of the underground temple mention a 'Holy Foe'`
  - `I have translated the Orcish prophecies and discovered what the five hearts are about.`
- at least partially invulnerable to psionic magic
  - `the orcs don't react to my magic spells like the gullible people in the Old Camp do` (Baal Lukor, G1-final)
- orcs can learn human language, and humans can learn orcish language
  - this skill is no longer available to player in the final release of the game
- originally they were supposed to be named differently than `orcs`, but a suitable name was never invented

## Known living orcs

### Grub
- enslaved orc shaman at _Royal Ore Mine_, speaking human language
- `meet GRUB in room, with pointy black rock`

### Tarrok
- slave at the _Free Mine_, speaking human language
- friend of _Ur-Shak_
- knows how to make _Ulu-Mulu_, while _Ur-Shak_ apparently doesn't

### Ur-Shak
- shaman speaking human language
- `He's not on good terms with his brothers in the Orc town`
- `a banished Orc shaman in the ruins of a castle`
- many years ago used to be a slave in the _Free Mine_ with _Tarrok_, but managed to escape

## Relationship with trolls
- in the released game, orcs and trolls are never seen together
- Gothic comic shows the _Northern Hordes_ as made of both orcs and some trolls
- early design docs mention orc patrols in _abandoned mine_ including an `war troll`
  - German: `Orkpatroullien in VM (incl. Kriegstroll?)` (in `Phoenix Hauptmissionen`)


## Morlocks
- removed pre-alpha guild, already in 0.56 alpha mentioned as `GIL_MRL = 17; // (gibt es nicht mehr)` (`no longer used`)
- was on the list of human guilds, separate from `GIL_ORC = 21` which is on the list of monster guilds
  - later numbers were rearranged, so that we got `GIL_ORC = 17` on that position
- according to design docs, they were half orcs (citation needed)
- in the earliest map sketch, were supposed to live in a deep forest behind the _Sect Camp_
  - later this forest camp was removed, and instead they were living among humans in other camps
- name `morlock` comes from fictional underground orc-like species in public domain 1895 novel `The Time Machine`
