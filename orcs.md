- orcs bury their dead in underground tombs
- "The Orcs used to bury their dead there, that's why we call this system of caves the Orc cemetery."

- there was an advanced orc culture centuries or millenium ago around __Khorinis__
  - one of the clans summoned arch demon to give them strength for war
  - it had access to human slaves
  - in current times there's no trace of it, and humans don't seem to be aware of the reason
  - it is possible for arch mage imprisoned around __Royal Ore Mines__ to mostly find out about the reason

  - "which they hoped would give their clan the power to defeat their enemies."
