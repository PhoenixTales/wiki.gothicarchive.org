## Orcish Talisman
- seems to be made by orc shamans
- defends from fire damage
  - grants 20 points of protection against it, but the _Orc Hunter_ wearing it is completely immune to fire
- was acquired by _The Orc Hunter_ who was later turned into zombie by curse guarding the _Focus Stone_ under the _Stone Circle Of The Damned_
- `I'm looking for an Orcish talisman (...) its former owner used it to defend himself against angry Orcs.`
- it's 3d model name is `ItMi_Amulet_UluMulu_01`, suggesting it was originally used as variant of Ulu-Mulu
- in the final release, _orc shaman_ _Ur-Shak_ says `Take Ur-Shak talisman! Talisman protect from breath of fire lizard!` but doesn't actually give anything

## Potion "Mad Bull"
- causes temporary madness (`Npc_SetToMad (self,30)`)
- looks like a vial of yellow liquid

## Potion "Sprinting Horse"
- sprint potion
- originally it was a spell called _Speed_
- in alpha 0.64b the effect appears to be permanent, but it's probably unintentional
- drinking it triggers `SpellFX_Sprint` (also in the final release), which may suggest that originally it was going to be a magic spell

## PSI Potion
- appears in alpha builds, is almost for sure the same as _Sruup_
- vial with yellow liquid, uses mesh `drug.3ds` and material `IT_DRUG_YELLOW`
- _Quicktongue_ and others call it simply `PSI` or `drug` without explicitly mentioning `vial` or `potion`
- increases attributte `madness` by 5 (counter-intuitively, this probably means getting _less_ close to becoming insane)
  - the only other item affecting this attribute is `Holy Water`, increasing it by 10
- there is a related mission, _Bring Psi Potion_ (`I urgently need a PSI vial`)
- `There isn't much to pick up in the cult camp other than mountains of drug vials` (`Inf_Org_SL`)

## Psionic Articat

## Rune Stones
- see _Magic_

## Rune Sword
- appears in alpha builds
- has owner set to _Mastermind_, but there are multiple NPCs with "copies" of it: _Earon_, _Hellfire_ and _Hawkeye_
- has extra magic damage and unique visual `special_sword.3ds`
- offered as reward by _Hawkeye_ for delivering him _Sruup_
- it can be deduced from early alphas that one was stored in the _Chapel Of Old Camp Castle_
  - quest `Steal The Old Sword Of Fire Mages` was originally about stealing "old sword" from that chapel
  - later version of that quest was changed to be about stealing that sword from directly from _Hellfire_, and in this version of the scripts we can see that the sword in his inventory is indeed the _Rune Sword_ 
  - worth to _Nimblefinger_ more than a _Fire Stone_

## Sacrificial Dagger

- `Without Sruup you will go just as insane as when you approach the barrier.`
- has `pungent odor` (German: `ein stechender Geruch`) (_Sleeper's Ban_)
- almost for sure the same as `PSI Potion` in alpha game builds

## Stone plate

- description: `Black like the soul. Black like the night. Black like the evil. Black promises might.`

  - it's the only blend mentioned in the document, the one which _Novices_ receive daily and which is traded with other camps

### Other games
- Gothic 2:
  - described as `resinous stalk`, and package of it as `sticky` and `stinking`
  - subjectively slows down the time, `helps against all sorts of pain and clears the head`
  - can be mixed with tobacco
  - is required for creating the _Sleep_ spell rune
  - `excessive use of the swampweed` causes users to be `more confused than believable` and they are `no longer able to work, let alone wield a weapon`, `completely stoned`
  - trade in _Swampweed_ is persecuted by militia (`If the city guards catch me with that, they'll throw me into jail`)
  - _Vatras_ claims that `a lot of swampweed is required for this ritual` which is the only way to repair _Eye Of Innos_ and save the world
   - he reminds player `don't forget to bring the swampweed. I am counting on you`
   - _Vatras_ is suspiciously well informed where to get it even though trade in it is illegal and risks imprisonment by _Militia_, he advises the player that there is a witch in the woods who collects and sells _Swampweed_ among other herbs, and also hints where it can be bought in the city
   - later admits that it was not actually needed, and they conduct ritual without it just fine
   - `VATRAS: Indeed, there is nothing missing now for the performance of the ritual. HERO: What about the swampweed? VATRAS: Ah, yes. Do you have swampweed plants, then? HERO: No. Alas not. VATRAS: All right. Then we shall have to make do without.`
- Gothic 2 NotR:
  - _Fortuno_ suggests that even the _Green Novice_, weakest of the weed blends prepared by _The Sect_, is stronger than pure _Swampweed_ joint prepared in a simple way
  - `Green Novice` joint can be made by mixing `essence of two swampweed plants and a meadow knotweed`
- Gothic 3:
  - `Swampweed, stranger. Pure, fine swampweed. (...) The conditions are ideal - lots of sun, fresh breezes... That makes the pollen unbelievably fine.`

- `The grapes are blended with the common syos herb` (book `Recipes`)
  - German: `Die Trauben werden vor der Kellerei mit dem gemeinen Syos-kraut versetzt.`

## Teleport Stone
- single item `TeleportStone` connected with single spell `Spell_Teleportation`
- as opposed to teleportation spells in the final release, this one does not lead to any particular location
- it moves the character to a random position within certain radius, for example to quickly evade enemies in fight
- in the script has comment `magischer Teleport-Stein`, using it calls engine function `Npc_SetTeleportPos(self)` of unclear purpose
- in alpha release where it is still present in scripts, it uses placeholder model `mallet.3ds` (a hammer)
  - later builds, including final release have mesh of matching name `ItMi_Teleportstone_01.3ds`
  - it looks like a piece of natural quartz-like crystal made of 5 parts
  - in builds with the model present, the script is already removed

## Throwable weapons
- in early alpha some ranged weapons were supposed to be "amunition for themselves" and get thrown
- 0.56 alpha `constants.d`: `CONST INT MUN_THROW = 1; // Keine, die Fernkampfwaffe selbst wird geworfen`
- _Kodang Wood_ from _Sleeper's Ban_ is a weapon of this kind

## Ulu-mulu
- `sign of friendship` respected by orcs (unless wielder attacks or uses magic)
- the Nameless describes it as `an Orcish symbol for friendship` (`Info_Gorn_FOUNDULUMULU_Info`)
- has a form of large totem that can be used as a weapon
- probably an amulet variant was originally planned, the _Orcish Talisman_ uses 3d model with a matchig name
- shows that the wielder is a strong warrior who collected trophies of powerful beasts: _fire waran_, _shadowbeast_, _troll_ and a _swampshark_
- in early design docs, made of `the horn of a shadowbeast, the bone of a troll and the feathers of a rock bird` and described as a `totem, a kind of spear`
  - German: `dem Horn eines Shadowbeasts, dem Knochen eines Trolls und den Federn eines Felsvogels`, `Totem, eine Art Speer`
  - source: `Phoenix Hauptmissionen`
- use of Ulu-Mulu was supposed to involve going to the gate of the underground _Orc City_ and there ram the (spear-shaped) Ulu-Mulu into the ground
  - then one of guarding orcs would challenge the hero to a duel, and once hero wins, he would be granted access to the orc chieftain
- early design docs mention that after New Camp temporarily allied with the orcs, wearing the helmet of New Camp Guardian similarly allowed the hero to safely enter the Orc City, even if the hero was actually a member of Old Camp or Sect Camp
  - (Old Camp / New Camp / Sect Camp) hero `can go to Orc City with helmet of Guardian`
  - `New Camp allies with orcs. New Camp - Guardians wear marked helmets from now on`, `can go to Orc City with helmet of Guardian`
  - German: `NL verbündet sich mit Orks. NL-Ga tragen von nun an (spätestens) gekennzeichnete Helme.`, `kann mit Ga-Helm in Orkstadt gehen` (source: `Phoenix Hauptmissionen`)
- Gorn describes it as `Orc standard` (`Info_Gorn_FOUNDULUMULU_Info`)

## Uriziel
- `Ancient runes have been engraved into the blade`, `It says here, Uriziel the Great`
  - `Hier steht, Uriziel das Grosse.` (G1-1.01d, ou.bin)
- `This ancient blade supposedly had immense powers before, but in the course of the years it's lost its magic energy`
- can be `magically charged` using heap of _magic ore_
- it contains magic rune known as _Ring of Death_ that `has Beliar's powers`
  - it is mentioned in book _Sixth Circle of Magic_ sold by _Mages Of Fire_ and _Mages Of Water_ under Magic Barrier Of Khorinis
  - `the big blue jewel in the blade. It contains the magical powers of the blade. If I remove the jewel, I'll be able to create a magic rune which contains the attributes of URIZIEL itself.` (G1-final, DIA_KDF_404_Xardas.d)
  - before charging it was `plain gray gem`, and after it became `shimmering bluish`
  - book `The Sixth Circle` says that `the rune carrying the powers of URIZIEL (...) has Beliar's powers.`
- orcs took it from the defeated _Ancient General_ 
  - `the Orcs took it from a powerful warlord`
  - `Dead Paladin in ancient temple behind door, sieged by undeads -> has weapon against Sleeper with him` (early design docs)
- the only weapon that can hurt the final undead boss before the sleeper
  - in alpha it was the _Undead Dragon_, in final it was 5th High Orc Priest
- sword powerful enough to harm, but not kill, arch demon
- has codename `Mythrilklinge`
  - reference to supernatural metal from _Lord Of The Rings_ that could only be find in a mine that was just above imprisoned enormous primeval demon (`Balrog`) 
- `It's a weapon from the olden days, when the human race was still young.`
- can be used to make a rune that `has Beliar's powers`, called `Wave of Death`
- `the weapon was able to pierce the strongest armor and to overcome even the most powerful of protection spells.`
  - ability to overcome / neutralize spells is not normally associated with _Magic Ore_ (which instead powers / strengthens spells), it may hint that another special alloy was used for the blade
  - Xardas would be probably able to recognize a blade made of Magic Ore, but instead he says Uriziel `was forged from an unknown material`
  - Uriziel's magic power comes not from the blade, but from the `blue jewel` that looks similar to Mana Potions (which are made of Magic Ore) and can be transformed into a Rune Stone (which are made of Magic Ore)
- `This sword is forged from a noble ore by dwarves who were master craftsmen`
  - `Dieses Schwert ist aus einem edelen Erz geschmiedet, von Zwergen, die ihr Handwerk meisterlich verstanden`
  - this sentence was later removed, and all later references to _dwarves_ are displayed as easter eggs
  - `The weapon was forged from an unknown material. And there's nothing written about who created it!`
- after charging deals fire damage (30 pts), can set enemies and flammable objects (like torch holders) on fire
- Uriziel is famous enough that the book `The Sixth Circle` mentions it by name

## The Wine of Oblivion
- only mentioned in the book `Recipes`
- `The best grapes for this wine are found high up on the slopes of Archolos`
- `The grapes are blended with the common syos herb`
- recipe is followed by vague text implying it has hallucinogenic or magical properties:
  - `Observe and marvel as the master turns the clearest well water into excellent wine. The master punishes his lazy disciples by locking them in bottles. A fire is miraculously ignited and black serpents rise up.`
  - German: `Sehet und staunet, wenn der Magister klarstes Brunnenwasser zu vortrefflichen Wein verwandelt. Der Magister seine faulen Lehrlinge zur Strafe in Flaschen sperrt, Feuer sich auf wundersame Weise entzündet und schwarze Schlangen emporwachsen.`


## Winepipe
