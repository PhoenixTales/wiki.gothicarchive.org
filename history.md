## Common knowledge
- _kingdom of Myrtana_ "united" (conquered/annexed?) _Nordmar_, _Varant_ and 4th land
  - according to Myrtanian chronicle, _Varant_ initially started the war with intent to conquer _Myrtana_, but in the end was conquered instead
- months are called _moons_ and by corresponding constellation
  - `In a few weeks, when the moon of the Unicorn will be complete.`
  - `Many moons had passed`
- years are divided into (2) _solstices_
  - `This war lasted more than four solstices`
 
## Timeline
- _Ancient Times_
- _Golden Age Of Myrthana_ ruled by _Rhobar I_
- _War with Varant_
- _Rhotbar I_ dies when that atumn turns into winter
- few unnamed kings rule in between
  - this is mentioned by Mike, not in the booklets
- _Rhotbar II_, son of _Rhotbar I_ ascends to the throne without ceremony
- _First Orc War_
  - `The situation was bad all over the country, especially in the mining towns. Thieves and deserters rioted and many prisoners fled the mines`
  - _Magic Barrier Of Khorinis_ is created to help with war effort
  - raids quietly ended, Myrtana recovered
- _Second Orc War_
  - orcs come back stronger and better organized
  - Myrtana is going to lose that war

## Ancient Times
- ancient Khorinis orcs first won battle against humans and _Ancient General_, but then their society mysteriously collapsed
- in early days of human race, humans coexisted with orcs on the surface, until racist conflicts led the orcs to seek refuge in underground cities
- there are prophecies that apocalyptic crisis from almost 1000 years ago is going to return
  - `constellations of stars start moving to the same positions`

## Golden Age Of Myrtana
- Myrtana prospers during rule of _Rhobar I_
- `Gods looked upon Myrtana with a kind heart and blessed all the land with peace, lavish crops and an abundance of Copper, bronze and Ore. Myrtana thrived in this blissful age`

## War with Varant
- war lasts `over 4 solstices`, on both land and the sea
- won thanks to good strategy of a general, and military use of _Fire Magic_
- king `was not satisfied with protecting the country's borders, (...) advanced deep into the country and conquered counties, villages and cities. And whatever his troops could not hold was razed to the ground. (...)had the ruler of Varant hanged, appointed a governor and a council`
 
### Speculation
- Varantian conquest turned into defeat because of a [black swan event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) involving heroic individual like _General Lee_
- _Varant_ could have been unaware of use of _Fire Magic_ by army of Myrtana: maybe it was first known military use, or even public witnessing of such magic in these times
- initial aggression of _Varant_ on _Myrtana_ could have been a [false flag operation meant to provoke a war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#As_pretexts_for_war), and Rhobar knew that Myrtanian army is stronger, or that _Fire Magic_ will ensure their victory

## First Orc War
- orc raids started during first year of reign of _Rhobar II_, after death of _Rhobar I_
  - `King Rhotbar died that winter (...) But when winter was over, the kingdom was facing the next danger.`
  - it was few months after conquest of _Varant_
- according to booklet Orcs came from the North, while according to Mike in early plans this invasion came from underground caves
  - `Orc hordes from the northlands swept across the borders and plundered hamlets and estates`
  - `Hoards of ores invading the land from the North`
- `the king sent out his armies, had borders fortified and sent protective troops into the contested areas.`
- 
- raids somehow ended quietly (?) 
  - `battles (...) were small, brief skirmishes with no victors`
  - `The kingdom was gradually recovering from the wounds of the past. Wheat flourished in the fields and new trade agreements were signed.`
- on _Khorinis_ there are `old fortifications dating back to the time of the first Orc war`

## Second Orc War
- `King Rhotbar knew the orcs were strong enough to wage war against Myrtana. But his army had grown small and few weapons were left at his disposal.`
- `And then the orcs came. Like a storm swept over the land, the armies cut down and killed every human being that fell into their hands.`
- king decides to send all sorts of prisoners and enemies of the society to _Royal Mines Of Khorinis_
- royal army is losing the war
