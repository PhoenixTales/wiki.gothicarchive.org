## Common knowledge
- _kingdom of Myrtana_ "united" (conquered/annexed?) _Nordmar_, _Varant_ and 4th land
  - according to Myrtanian chronicle, _Varant_ initially started the war with intent to conquer _Myrtana_, but in the end was conquered instead
- months are called _moons_ and by corresponding constellation
  - `In a few weeks, when the moon of the Unicorn will be complete.`
 
### Speculation
- Varantian conquest turned into defeat because of a [black swan event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) involving heroic individual like _General Lee_
- _Varant_ could have been unaware of use of _Fire Magic_ by army of Myrtana: maybe it was first known military use, or even public witnessing of such magic in these times
- initial aggression of _Varant_ on _Myrtana_ could have been a [false flag operation meant to provoke a war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#As_pretexts_for_war), and Rhobar knew that Myrtanian army is stronger, or that _Fire Magic_ will ensure their victory

## Ancient history
- ancient Khorinis orcs first won battle against humans and _Ancient General_, but then their society mysteriously collapsed
- in early days of human race, humans coexisted with orcs on the surface, until racist conflicts led the orcs to seek refuge in underground cities
- there are prophecies that apocalyptic crisis from almost 1000 years ago is going to return
  - `constellations of stars start moving to the same positions`
