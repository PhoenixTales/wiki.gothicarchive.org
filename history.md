## Common knowledge
- _kingdom of Myrtana_ "united" (conquered/annexed?) _Nordmar_, _Varant_ and 4th land
  - according to Myrtanian chronicle, _Varant_ initially started the war with intent to conquer _Myrtana_, but in the end was conquered instead
- months are called _moons_ and by corresponding constellation
  - `In a few weeks, when the moon of the Unicorn will be complete.`
 
### Speculation
- Varantian conquest turned into defeat because of a [black swan event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) involving heroic individual like _General Lee_
- _Varant_ could have been unaware of use of _Fire Magic_ by army of Myrtana: maybe it was first known military use, or even public witnessing of such magic in these times
- initial aggression of _Varant_ on _Myrtana_ could have been a [false flag operation meant to provoke a war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#As_pretexts_for_war), and Rhobar knew that Myrtanian army is stronger, or that _Fire Magic_ will ensure their victory

## Ancient history
- ancient Khorinis orcs first won battle against humans and _Ancient General_, but then their society mysteriously collapsed
- in early days of human race, humans coexisted with dwarves and probably orcs
- dwarves seem to have disappeared very early
- there are prophecies that apocalyptic crisis from almost 1000 years ago is going to return
  - `constellations of stars start moving to the same positions`

## War with orcs
- war with orcs started during first year of reign of _Rhobar II_, after death of _Rhobar I_
- it was few months after conquest of _Varant_
- `King Rhotbar died that winter (...) But when winter was over, the kingdom was facing the next danger. Orc hordes from the northern lands came over the borders and plundered hamlets and estates. `
- `army had become small and few weapons were available to him. He needed ore to make new weapons. The situation was bad all over the country, especially in the mining towns. Thieves and deserters rioted and many prisoners fled the mines`
- first war somehow ended (`The kingdom was gradually recovering from the wounds of the past. Wheat flourished in the fields and new trade agreements were signed.`)
- _Royal Ore Mines_ are in area around front lines during the _First Orc War_
- there are `old fortifications dating back to the time of the first Orc war`
