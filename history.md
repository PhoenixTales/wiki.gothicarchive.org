## Ancient Times
- `It's a weapon from the olden days, when the human race was still young. (...) forged from an unknown material. And there's nothing written about who created it!`
  - German: `es ist eine Waffe aus alten Tagen, als die Menschheit noch jung war. Die Waffe ist aus einem völlig unbekannten Material geschmiedet. Auch über den Erschaffer steht nichts geschrieben!`
  - source: dialogue `Info_Xardas_LOADSWORD_Info` in the final G1 release
- ancient Khorinis orcs first won battle against humans and _Ancient General_, but then their society mysteriously collapsed
- in early days of human race, humans coexisted with orcs on the surface, until racist conflicts led the orcs to seek refuge in underground cities
- there are prophecies that apocalyptic crisis from almost 1000 years ago is going to return
  - `constellations of stars start moving to the same positions`
 
### Ancient War Of Priests
- book `Words Of The Gods` suggests that separation between priests of Innos and Adanos started with an ancient war, initiated by priests of Innos who rebelled against him
- `Innos raised the few who had shown him gratitude above the others (...) people called them priests. But among them were many who soon became dissatisfied. And so it happened that they prayed to Adanos and forgot their origins. The league of priests was divided. Wars ensued (...) And so the priests were separated.`
- German: `Die Riege der Priester war gespalten. Kriege wurden entfesselt`

### Other games
- Gothic 3
  - mentions civilization known as `the Ancient Ones`
  - `the dark magical arts of the Ancient Ones` that summons `the undead` and `spawn of hell`
  - `the Ancient Ones possessed their own kind of magic`
  - their commanders stayed undead until modern times: `Let's battle some undead. The commanders of the Ancient Ones do not belong in this time.`
  - their empire included Varant: `We are here in Al Shedim, a temple city of the Ancient Ones`
  - some of them worshipped _Innos_, later bringing that faith to _Nordmar_: `Akascha, a warrior of the Ancient Ones`, `A very long time ago, a man came to Nordmar. A man inspired by the fire of Innos. He came from far away, from the south. He became one of us, a Nordmarian. This man was Akascha. Some Nordmarians were convinced that Akascha got his strength from Innos. They followed him and started to pray to Innos.`
  - they coexisted with _The Nomads Of The Desert_ who worshipped _Adanos_, and _Ancient Ones_ were greately angered by one of them joining _The Nomads_ to worship _Adanos_
    - `Haran Ho was a great warrior of the Ancient Ones. His travels led him deep into the desert. There he learned the nomads' way of life and came to cherish it. Haran Ho recognized the wisdom of the Water Mages and understood the power of Adanos. Finally, he gave up his old life and joined the nomads. His decision angered the rulers of the Ancient Ones. On their orders, the hunt for Haran Ho began.`
  - some ancient people of _Varant_, likely members of _The Ancient Ones_, were building a `portal` for _Innos_ to physically enter the world of mortals and unleash his full power there, similar to one that _Orc Shamans_ used to summon _The Sleeper_
    - `And Innos spoke to his servants: 'Erect a portal for me, so that I might reign over this world in all eternity!' And his servants did as they were bidden.`

## Origin Of Myrtana

### Other games
Origin of Myrtana is only described in Gothic 3:

> The barbarians lived in Nordmar. And Rhobar was one of them. (...) And Innos said to Rhobar: Descend from the mountains, and defeat my enemies. And Rhobar waged war against the orcs. And the wrath of Innos descended upon them. And Rhobar was victorious. Once his enemies were defeated, Innos said to him: This is where you shall establish your kingdom. And Rhobar did as he was bidden.

## Golden Age Of Myrtana
- Myrtana prospers during rule of _Rhobar I_
- `Gods looked upon Myrtana with a kind heart and blessed all the land with peace, lavish crops and an abundance of Copper, bronze and Ore. Myrtana thrived in this blissful age`

## War with Varant
- war lasts `over 4 solstices`, on both land and the sea
- won thanks to good strategy of a general, and military use of _Fire Magic_
- king `was not satisfied with protecting the country's borders, (...) advanced deep into the country and conquered counties, villages and cities. And whatever his troops could not hold was razed to the ground. (...)had the ruler of Varant hanged, appointed a governor and a council`

## First Orc War
- orc raids started during first year of reign of _Rhobar II_, after death of _Rhobar I_
  - `King Rhotbar died that winter (...) But when winter was over, the kingdom was facing the next danger.`
  - it was few months after conquest of _Varant_
- according to booklet Orcs came from the North, while according to Mike in early plans this invasion came from underground caves and had no single front line
  - `Orc hordes from the northlands swept across the borders and plundered hamlets and estates`
  - `Hoards of ores invading the land from the North`
- `the king sent out his armies, had borders fortified and sent protective troops into the contested areas.`
- raids somehow ended quietly (?) 
  - `battles (...) were small, brief skirmishes with no victors`
  - `The kingdom was gradually recovering from the wounds of the past. Wheat flourished in the fields and new trade agreements were signed.`
- on _Khorinis_ there are `old fortifications dating back to the time of the first Orc war`
  - according to Mike, that's because in those times Orc lived all over (under) Myrthana, not only in the North
- `Following the heavy battles in the north, every countryman now knows how to use a bow and arrows.`
 
### Other games
Gothic 3 suggests that _First Orc War_ was won by Orcs:

> After the first great war, the orcs ruled the kingdom of Myrtana. And the humans were their slaves.

## Second Orc War
- the front line was along the _Northern Plains_
- `the great Orc Wars in the north`
- `King Rhotbar knew the orcs were strong enough to wage war against Myrtana. But his army had grown small and few weapons were left at his disposal.`
- `And then the orcs came. Like a storm swept over the land, the armies cut down and killed every human being that fell into their hands.`
- king decides to send all sorts of prisoners and enemies of the society to _Royal Mines Of Khorinis_
- royal army is losing the war
