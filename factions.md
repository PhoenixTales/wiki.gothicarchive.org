- there's mention of _Crusade_ (`Kreuzzug`)

## Diggers

  - `KDF_40_FoeKilledDigger`: `Hey, nobody gets away with killing our working animals`
  - `OU_NPCS_DEMO3_SLD_GRIMFACE_225`: `Trying to outright talk us into giving up our workhorses` (German: `Versucht doch glatt uns unsere Arbeitstiere abzuschwatzen`)

## Farmers of Khorinis Mine Valley
- German: `Die Bauern` (`BAU`)
- live around the _Old Citadel_ (German: `Altes Kastell`)
  - originally, the New Camp was more in the south and the _Old Citadel_ was on a mountain just west from it, with all the fields in front of it and the river from the New Camp running through the fields
- peaceful, grow their own food and trade it with camps
- some of them lived around the valley already before it became prison colony
- `know how to grow grain and a few of them can even brew really good beer` (_Sleeper's Ban_)

- known as `die Recken` in German version of _Sleeper's Ban_, and as `Die Garde` (`GRD`) in alpha builds
- protect _Alchemists of Water_ and farmers living in _New Camp_

## Guild of Mages
- only mentioned in _Sleeper's Ban_, as `der Magiergilde`
- ruled by 12 _Principals_ (`Prinzipalen`)
  - originally they were all _Alchemists Of Fire_, later 6 of them were replaced with _Alchemists Of Water_

## Masters
- German: `Die Meister` (`MST`)
- secret secondary guild accepting members of all the camps
- it's much harder to discover and join than the three camps
- 4 Friends (Diego, Milten, Lester and Gorn) are members of it
- player was supposed to have a chance of discovering and joining it
- `SLD_21_NSCASpeech`: `Just listen people. This is the masters message.` (unclear if he actually means this guild)

## Mercenaries Of Old Camp
- in final released version of Gothic I known as `The Guards Of Old Camp`
- in German version of `Sleeper's Ban` known as `Söldnergilde` and in alpha builds as `Die Söldner` (`SLD`)
- in original English translation of the alpha builds called `soldiers`
  - `Nobody'll ever get away with killing a soldier of the ore-barons`
- `the group that puts the Barons' ideas into practice.`
- supposed to protect the _Diggers_
  - `You've knocked down a Digger. That wasn't clever. The Ore-Barons pay us for protecting them, so don't do that shit again`

## Miner's Association
- German: `Der Schürferbund` (`SFB`)
- work at _Free Mine_
- allied with the _New Camp_

## Nobility
- _The Nobles_ have "dirty business" and are jelaous of generals' influence
  - design docs imply that general(s) are also "Lords" (nobles)
- known ranks of nobility: `king`, `lord`, `burgrave`, possibly `baron`
  - `ore barons` likely based their title on a title used outside of the barrier rather than inventing it from scratch

## Guards
- in alpha builds a distinct guild (German: `Der Waechter` / `WCH`)
- on the guild list, they are between _The Orcs_ and _The Sleeper_, and this word is only mentioned in context of orcs:
  - `B_OrcGuard_ObserveIntruder: Waechter sieht Player`
  - `B_OrcGuard_ObserveIntruder: Waechter tutet ins Horn -> TOR`
  - `ZS_OrcGUARD_ObserveIntruder_Loop: Waechter!`
  - `ZS_OrcGuard_ObserveIntruder_Loop: Ork-Waechter zieht Waffe`
- but there's also a file `INF_WCH.BAK` which inside contains code for `Inf_Sld` and `GIL_SLD`, suggesting it's renamed version of _Mercenaries Of Old Camp_
- probably by accident, set as owner of moveable world objects of type `TableHeavy`


## Ore Barons
- rule the _Old Camp_ since the rebellion of the prisoners
- in alpha called by their mercenaries `king-like ruler`, `our master`, `our big boss`, `our leader`, `The Baron`
  - singular form suggests that there was supposed to be only one of them (?)
  - `VLK_50_FoeAttackedEBr`: `the baron is mighty as god`
  - `VLK_50_FoeStoleFromEBr`: `Isn't the leader great and wise ?`

## Psionics
- `orange-clad` (_Sleeper's Ban_)
- `spend their whole day singing songs, stuffing themselves with all sorts of drugs as if it was a cotton candy` (_Sleeper's Ban_)
- `those 'I see the light' guys who believe that the visions and nightmares have something to do with someone deep down, an uncanny power that saves us all` (_Sleeper's Ban_)
- `bang like rabbits` according to an Old Camp member
- their gurus are told to be able to `float in the air`
- `They report some power that resides deep beneath us. And they try to awaken this power and call for help with some dark ceremonies.` (_Sleeper's Ban_)
- `hold black masses every now and then in order to get through to this being with magical rituals` (_Sleeper's Ban_)
- some blame them for demonic visions and earthquakes troubling the prisoners
- script programmers refer to them as `sect suckers` even when it's about one psionic talking about another
  - `NOV_130_FriendKilledSectSucker`: `Hey you killed a friend of all of us. Go away and beg the sleeper for pardon.`
- in alpha they call each other cute names (?!)
 - `NOV_130_FriendStoleFromEBr`: `Stupid pumpkin, you stole from the baron`

## Shadows Of The Old Camp
- secretive spies and assassins working for _Ore Barons_
- their headquarters are in the dungeons of _Old Camp Castle_
- for obvious reasons they are unlikely to wear easily recognizable uniforms and may even pretend to be members of other factions
- in the final release of the game they are no longer spies, assassins nor secretive, and instead are more like simply a lower rank of the _Old Camp Guard_ and consistently wear red armors

## Stomp's Family
- only mentioned in _Sleeper's Ban_
- `respected merchant family`
- `one of the largest trading houses in his hometown, used to living in a large mansion, looked after by servants`
- wife of the family's head died, and he married again
  - he has two sons, one from the first marriage who is his heir, and one from second marriage who is jealous of being the heir
  - `his stepbrother, the man who came into the family through his father's second marriage and envied him from the start the position of heir.`

## The People
- German: `Das Volk`
- in original English translation of the early alpha mentioned as `normal people`
- `NOV_130_FriendDefeatedByVlk`: `You lost a fight with the normal people.`

## Trappers
- known in alpha builds as `Die Fallensteller` (`FLL`)
- correspond to _The Hunters_ from the final game (who wear _Organizer_ armors and are all _New Camp_ members)
