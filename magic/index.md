title: Magic
---

Spells can categorized in a few ways: based on in-game books, based on design docs, based on comments in the game scripts or based on texture of the scroll or runestone. These sources do not fully agree with each other.

- magic is also called `arcane power` and `Arcane Art`
- it's unclear if magic originates from the mage himself, or from the gods:
  - `The First Circle`: `All magic originates from the magic powers of the user`, `Every activation of a magic spell costs the magician a portion of his powers.`, `spells remain in force for as long as the magician lets his mana flow into them`
  - `The Secrets of Magic`: `magus' spirit rises above our sphere and gazes upon the Other Side, the home of power. The magus himself is but a conductor and shaper of that power`
  - `A Powerful Art`: `magician's ability to control the divine power grows`
- `the gods gave mankind the gift of magic, they taught them to make magic runes as well` (from book `The First Cirle`)
