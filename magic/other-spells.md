### Speed
- later changed into a potion _Sprinting Horse_

### Shrink
- only available as Scroll
- color-coded as Psionic spell but doesn't seem to belong there
  - for example, it was sold by merchants in Khorinis, likely before creation of the barrier (as the dead owner found within the barrier, notes that he bought it for gold coins with intention of killing the troll and become rich - this plan would make no sense if the barrier already existed at the moment)

### Magic of Teleportation
- according to the color-codes on the textures, teleportation spells do not belong to any single magic type
- do not belong to any magic circle (are "level 0")
- available destinations: Fire Mages, Water Mages, Demon Summoner, Orc Graveyard Secret, Ore Baron House
- `The special feature of these magic formulas is that, although they are bound in runes, they can be cast by anybody with magic powers. The magic of these formulas can be activated at once. There are no restrictions to the teleportation spell.`
