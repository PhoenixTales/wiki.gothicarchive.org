- `The magicians consider themselves to be the chosen ones - and that's how they treat others.` (_Milten_)
- `Magic is (...) A healing power that only a few chosen ones are able to control`
- `Our magic is a gift from the gods. We've been chosen to act as priests, tutors and judges. It is a gift which is a constant burden to us. A task which determines our lives.`
- `Every activation of a magic spell costs the magician a portion of his powers. These powers are referred to as mana.`
