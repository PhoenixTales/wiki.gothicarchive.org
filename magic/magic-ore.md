- used for making the famous alloy known as `steel of Khorinis`, considered the best in entire _Myrtana_
  - `weapons forged from the finest steel of Khorinis, and high prices are still paid for such weapons throughout Myrtana` (book `Magic Ore`)
- known since ancient times
  - used by `Kings and heroes of old`
  - main material of the magic armor of the _Ancient General_ who wielded _Uriziel_
- `The magic ore does have special qualities. Weapons forged from it don't break, their blades are sharper than usual ones.`
- `the magic powers of the ore vanish during the smelting process`
- produces a steel alloy: `ore mines of Khorinis ... A weapon forged from this steel ...` (book `Magic Ore`)

- `no one willingly works in the ore mines`

  - `The best ore for use when forging weapons is doubtless found in the ore mines of Khorinis.`
- `of fundamental purity and suffused with magic`
- `of incomparable strength, yet so soft that it cannot break`
- `is a match for any blade, albeit made of the strongest steel`
- `It will break any shield and pierce any armor`
