title: Sun Magic
---

This group exists only based on texture information: all these spells are color-coded yellow. That color corresponds to texture `OtWaMaskSun.tga`, one from a set that matches well known deity symbols and colors associated with them and their spells. Mentions of sun magic are omitted in both early and late design docs. It is included here because these textures are present in the final version of the game, and it corresponds to a major (`highest`) deity, _Ra_, who is mentioned in the _Gothic Comic_.
