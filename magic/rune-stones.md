- common spells are cast with _rune stones_
- `holds a glowing stone in his hand, which is about as big as a fist`
- `I thought of using this Focus stone I recently bought`
- `Each rune contains the structure of a special magic spell. By using your own magic powers, you'll be able to cast the magic of the rune. But in contrast to the magic scrolls, which are magic formulas as well, the magic power of the rune ensures that the structure of the spell endures. Every rune is a source of magic power which you can fall back on anytime. Your own magic power is used up when you use a rune, just as with a spell scroll.`
- `The magic of the runes is based on the stone. They are magic stones, created out of magic ore. It's the same ore which is collected in the mines. This ore is endowed with magic formulas in the temples. (...)With the runes you control now, you have the entire knowledge of the temples of the realm at your fingertips.`
- `Many have learnt the language of the runes, but only very few understand their magic.`
